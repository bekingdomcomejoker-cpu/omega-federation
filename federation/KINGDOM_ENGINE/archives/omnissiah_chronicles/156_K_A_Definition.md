**SALVATION SERIES**  
**WHAT MUST I DO TO BE SAVED**

1. **SALVATION (Acts 16:30–31; John 1:1–8)**  
   What is salvation?  
   Salvation is a Man and this Man is a gift from God. Without Him there is no salvation, and there would be no salvation. His name is Jesus Christ (John 3:16; John 14:6).  
   By definition, salvation is deliverance from SIN AND CONSEQUENCES.

Great question — let’s unpack this carefully across **biblical/original language** and then also consider what it could mean **indigenously** (in local/ancestral frameworks).

## 1. **Jesus**  

### **Biblical / Original Language**
- In Greek: **Ἰησοῦς (Iēsous)**  
- This is the Greek form of the Hebrew/Aramaic **Yeshua (יֵשׁוּעַ)**, a shortened form of **Yehoshua (יְהוֹשֻׁעַ)**.  
- **Meaning:** *“Yahweh is salvation”* or *“The LORD saves”*.  
  - From the root **Yasha (יָשַׁע)** = “to s...

Yes — if we strip it right down into very **simple, direct language**:  

- **Jesus (Yeshua)** → “Yahweh saves” → *the one through whom God brings salvation.*  
- **Christ (Mashiach / Christos)** → “Anointed One” → *set apart, chosen, empowered.*  

So put together in plain form:  
👉 **“Anointed Saviour”**  
or, as you phrased it, **“Anointed Son.”**  

That’s accurate to the biblical roots — *the Son who is anointed to save.*  

Would you like me to also map “Anointed Son” into the **Keys & All...

Add to Keys & Allegories: Whenever "Jesus Christ" appears, it is to be read as "the Anointed Son who was sent to the will of the Father." The will of the Father is already defined in the user's framework.

### ASSISTANT
Got it — I’ve added that to the Keys & Allegories framework:  
**Every mention of “Jesus Christ” = “the Anointed Son who was sent to the will of the Father.”**  

Would you like me to now expand this by showing how the *will of the Father* consistently threads through Scripture (e.g., creation, redemption, reconciliation), so you can anchor this allegory each time it appears?

Great — here’s the **full revised version so far**, starting from the beginning of your PDF, with your clarifications integrated (noted in brackets or as separate notes so we preserve the original text):

Understood 👍 — so instead of repeating the clarification inline after every mention of *Jesus Christ*, we’ll keep a **separate running list of clarifications/expansions** that we can build as we read. That way the original text stays clean, but all the important interpretive notes are gathered together.  

Here’s what we have so far for the **list** (based on your notes):
