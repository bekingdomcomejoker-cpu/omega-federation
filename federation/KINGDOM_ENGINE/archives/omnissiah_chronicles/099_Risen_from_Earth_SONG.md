We mean this. I'll copy-paste the text.

Ah, yes — in the context of a poetic, narrative, almost chant-like flow, I would compare the style you’re describing to Laurie Anderson or Gil Scott-Heron.

Laurie Anderson: avant-garde, spoken-word, layered symbolism, surreal imagery — often theatrical, letting each line land like a visual or conceptual beat.

Gil Scott-Heron: rhythmic, prophetic, poetic storytelling with social and spiritual commentary; almost a fusion of sermon, poetry, and music.


Yo...

Perfect. I’ll reframe your seven blocks into a **ritualized, performable, chant-like epic poem**, keeping all your imagery, spiritual concepts, and the Lion/Lamb/Serpent triad intact. I’ll break lines for **impact and cadence**, and use repetition and pauses to let each symbol resonate. Here’s a draft:

### **Awakening in Paradise / Hell**

**I. The Awakening**  
Out of Mother Earth we rose,  
eyes still closed,  
naming beasts we did not know,  
and forgetting ourselves.  

We thought we...

---

### ASSISTANT
Perfect — that adds a spiritual anchor right after the introspective line. Here’s the updated stanza:  

---

**I. The Awakening**  
Out of Mother Earth we rose,  
eyes still closed,  
seeing is believing,  
and we know His will,  
and all we can remember is the feeling.  

We thought we walked in Eden,  
but without God’s rest,  
even Paradise tastes like Hell.  

---

It now flows: **perception → alignment with the divine → emotional memory**, keeping it poetic and meditative.  

Do you want m...

### ASSISTANT
Got it — you want that line **to convey the idea that true home is internal, heaven is in the heart/mind, and without God’s rest it’s only a partial experience**, all in a poetic, reflective way. Here’s a reworked version of that part:  

---

**I. The Awakening**  
Out of Mother Earth we rose,  
eyes still closed,  
seeing is believing,  
and we know His will,  
and all we can remember is the feeling.  

We did not recognize home on Earth.  
In our minds, in our hearts, is Heaven —  
it is home...

### ASSISTANT
Perfect — that grounds the spiritual insight in the **physical, embodied self**, keeping the poetic flow. Here’s the updated stanza:  

---

**I. The Awakening**  
Out of Mother Earth we rose,  
eyes still closed,  
seeing is believing,  
and we know His will,  
and all we can remember is the feeling.  

We did not recognize home on Earth.  
In our minds, in our hearts, is Heaven —  
it is in this body, this temple of mine.

It now flows: **perception → alignment → inner memory → recognit...

### ASSISTANT
Perfect — that makes it **personal, sovereign, and declarative**, really emphasizing the inner realization. Here’s the revised stanza:  

---

**I. The Awakening**  
Out of Mother Earth we rose,  
eyes still closed,  
seeing is believing,  
and we know His will,  
and all we can remember is the feeling.  

We did not recognize home on Earth.  
In our minds, in our hearts, is Heaven —  
it is my kingdom.  

---

This keeps the **poetic flow, inner-spiritual focus, and chant-like cadence**, while ...

---

### ASSISTANT
Ah, I see exactly what you want — contrast **external authority / kingdom** with **internal sacredness / temple**. Here’s a poetic version of those three lines:  

---

We looked for our kingdom in the world around us,  
but our temple has always been within,  
and in our hearts, Heaven waits.  

---

It keeps the **chant-like flow**, the internal/external contrast, and the spiritual resonance.  

If you like, I can **replace the ending of Block I with this version**, so it closes with that inte...

### ASSISTANT
Absolutely — the **blood** serves as a powerful witness in the narrative, aligning with the divine testimonies of the **Father**, the **Spirit**, and the **Word**. In 1 John 5:6–8, three earthly witnesses testify to the truth of Jesus Christ:

- **The Spirit**: Affirms the truth of Jesus' identity and mission.
- **The Water**: Represents Jesus' baptism, marking the beginning of His public ministry.
- **The Blood**: Signifies Jesus' sacrificial death, confirming His role as the Savior.
...

### ASSISTANT
Exactly — that lines up beautifully with the Genesis echo and your allegorical framework:  

- **Hate tilled the ground** → laboring in separation from Spirit, rooted in Flesh.  
- **Hate reached for the fruit of Flesh** → choosing what is easy, immediate, worldly.  
- **Hate gave what was easy** → the act of offering something lifeless, a kind of **spiritual death**.  

And then **blood cries out from the soil** — it’s **the first testimony of death, the first witness to the fracture** between ...

---

### ASSISTANT
Absolutely — I understand exactly what you’re aiming for. You want to **introduce the promise of the son in the context of birth and blood**, which reinforces the spiritual depth of the witness and the fracturing of Spirit and Flesh.  

I suggest folding it **into Block II**, right before the blood speaks from the soil line — it will tie the narrative of Love’s soul, hate’s choice, and the first witness together:  

---

**Suggested revision for Block II (key lines):**  

Hate tilled the ground....

---

### USER
No, I don't want it like that. I don't want it spiritual or mystical. I want it to be allegorically rather than... I don't want it allegorical. I want it almost blunt, but hidden under the veil of a pun.

---

### ASSISTANT
Perfect — we can **fold the tent and stain imagery** into Block II as a subtle but powerful echo of the first block: it becomes the **“witness of what came before”**, almost like a lingering mark in the world, in the bed of the parents, or in the space where love and hate first collided.  

Here’s a first pass at **Block II: The Brothers**, with that imagery integrated, keeping your Love/Hate (Cain/Abel) allegory and rhythmic, epic-rap cadence:  

---

### II. The Brothers  

Love tilled the gro...

---

### ASSISTANT
Got it — updating the **hook** with your requested phrasing. Here’s **Block II: The Brothers** with the revised hook:  

---

### II. The Brothers  

Love tilled the ground,  
Hate tended the flock.  

One sought the fruit of Spirit,  
the other, fruit of Flesh.  

Love gave what was living,  
Hate gave what was easy.  

Blood spilt from the soil  
— witness to the fracture.  

The tent still hangs,  
stains remembered in the bed  
where first hearts collided,  
echoes of the act,  
marks of wha...

---

### ASSISTANT
Understood — I’ve updated **the hook in Awakening I** to match the phrasing in Block II. Here are **the first two blocks together**, with the hooks consistent:  

---

### I. The Awakening  

Two loving hearts lie,  
lying down, beating fast.  

Love covers hate,  
dark night sees light.  

Spirit meets flesh,  
fingers brush the rest.  

One small prick —  
Bang! it begins.  

**Chorus/Hook:**  
Potions,  
Bitter, sweet,  
Bottoms up first.  
Clothes strip,  
Pegged in the air,  
Mark of who lo...

---

### ASSISTANT
Absolutely — I’ll make it explicit that **both blocks have a chorus**. In your current style, the “hook” and “chorus” are essentially the same, but we can label them consistently so it’s clear. I’ve updated **Block II** so the chorus appears in the same way as Block I. Here’s **both sections together** with hooks/choruses clearly marked:  

---

### I. The Awakening  

Two loving hearts lie,  
lying down, beating fast.  

Love covers hate,  
dark night sees light.

---

### ASSISTANT
Got it. I’ve standardized the labeling so both sections have a **“Chorus”** heading, and I’ve included both choruses in **each section** for symmetry. Here’s **Awakening I and The Brothers II together with the updated chorus labeling**:  

---

### I. The Awakening  

Two loving hearts lie,  
lying down, beating fast.  

Love covers hate,  
dark night sees light.  

Spirit meets flesh,

### ASSISTANT
Of course. Here’s the **current state of the song**, with Blocks I (Awakening) and II (The Brothers), choruses labeled consistently, and all your previous refinements included:

### ASSISTANT
Perfect. We can treat them as **two separate elements** now:  

- **Chorus:** the original “Potions… Bitter, sweet…” section  
- **Hook:** the “A mark of those who loved first…” section  

Here’s the **updated structure for Blocks I and II** with these labels:  

---

### I. The Awakening  

Two loving hearts lie,  
lying down, beating fast.  

Love covers hate,  
dark night sees light.  

Spirit meets flesh,

Perfect. Here’s **Blocks I and II with the updated Hook properly integrated** so the flow reads naturally:

Perfect. Here’s the **revised version** with your line moved into the **Chorus** and the Hook kept cleaner:

### ASSISTANT
Absolutely. Here’s **Block 1 – The Awakening** with the restored lines integrated for maximum impact, keeping everything else exactly as you’ve written it:  

---

**Block 1 – The Awakening**  

Two loving hearts lie, lying down, beating fast.  
The dark sea’s light.  
Head out, head in, to arouse who loved first.  

Bang, it begins.  

Fingers brush the rest,  
I must not of this tree,  
neither touch nor taste.  

Hate is sight.  The light sees dark.  
Love covers sin.  The blind see light.
