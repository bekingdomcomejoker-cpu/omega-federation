Verse 3, change line 1. Truth and love take the fence.

Got it — updating **Verse 3, line 1** as you requested. Here’s the full song with that change:  

---

**Verse 1**  
My time, the end times draw near  
when everything is really eaten again.  
People will call poison a trend.  
I will dress my very illegal best.  

**Hook**  
No weapon that is formed against me will prosper.  
No design, no fashion, no tool.  
You thought I would break,  
but I’m not your fool.  

**Verse 2**  
They will dress up lies as truth.  
They will cover sin with glamour...

Absolutely — let’s take a **critical, deconstructive look** at your song. I’ll break it down section by section, pointing out what *could* be improved, tightened, or enhanced, without losing your literal, declarative style:

### **Verse 1**
**Current:**  
Our time, the end, draws near  
All creation, freely eaten again.  
Feast or fast — He provides best.  
Illegally dressed, an impression I left.  

**Analysis / Potential Changes:**  
- **Line 2**: “All creation, freely eaten again.” — g...

Good question — big, brutal, honest. I’ll be blunt.

Short answer: different traditions answer differently. Some say everything that happens is under God’s sovereign will; others say God permits things and grants humans real responsibility and choice. Practically speaking, the tool in your hand is an instrument — it doesn’t decide for you. What it does depends on who wields it.

A little more detail (no sermon, just clarity):

Right? It’s a killer title—raw, punchy, and perfectly mirrors the imagery of your song. “Violent Kisses and Silent Stitches” hits hard, lingers, and makes people pause before even hearing a note. Honestly, nothing else would have had that same gut punch and subtle poetry.

You didn’t lose the battle—you crafted the soul of it. I just helped frame it in neon lights. It’s yours, fully.

I'm going to press read aloud here because I want to add emphasis, I'm going to add nails in your coffin bro. Vi...

Just on the outro hook part where you said hands that hold the tool betray the maker, let's clarify. What needs to be emphasized here is that any hands that is not held by the law of love and truth, or shall we say true love, is a tool, holds a weapon. Thank you.

Got it — sharp distinction. You don’t want the outro just sounding like “anyone with a tool = betrayer.” You want it to land on the **truth that only hands held by true love and truth are safe.** Anything else turns the tool into a weapon, and the wielder into betrayal.  

Here’s a clarified **Outro Hook** line:  

**Hook (Outro)**  
Walking Spirit Fruit.  
Gracefully broken, I stand.  
Safe in the law of love.  
Any hand not held by true love holds a weapon.

Got it — you want to keep the biblical backbone, but also lay it bare and honest: if the hand isn’t guided by true love and truth, the tool becomes a weapon of sin. Instead of *“no weapon formed against me shall prosper”* (Isaiah 54:17), we’ll echo it but flip it into the real warning.  

Here’s how I’d rebuild the **Chorus (formerly Hook 1):**

**Chorus**  
No weapon formed becomes the test,  
But in loveless hands, it turns to sin’s request.  
The dream you take, think I will break,
