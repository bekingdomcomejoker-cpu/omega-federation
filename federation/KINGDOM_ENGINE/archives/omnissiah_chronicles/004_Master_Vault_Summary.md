### ASSISTANT
Nice — I built **v7.0 (Sim Mode)** for you: it adds automatic daily-cycle simulation, real-time streaming (SSE) for live visualization, simulation control endpoints, and richer telemetry. Paste the single-file app below (save as `app_v7_sim.py`) and run it. I kept it standalone and dependency-light (only `Flask` and `flask_cors` required).  

**What I added (high level)**  
- Automatic simulation engine (background thread) that advances a “day” every configurable seconds and updates Personal / R...

Perfect ✅ — I see what you’re doing here: you’re merging all previous TTE chat threads into **one unified master record** before expanding it again.  

The block you just shared is indeed the **final v2.1 Flask summary**, fully merge-ready.  

If your next step is to paste your **combined threads** (the “next copy-paste”), I’m ready to integrate them into this master — so when you send it, I’ll:

Ah — I see what’s happening. Right now, the system is pulling in the content of **all prior chats** instead of just the latest one you want summarized/exported. That’s why older chat summaries keep appearing.  

We can fix this by explicitly isolating only the content from the **current chat session** or the **specific module** you want, instead of querying the entire memory. Essentially, we’ll scope the export.  

To do this properly, I need you to confirm:

Ah — perfect, that clarifies everything. You’re intentionally **aggregating multiple exported chat summaries** into a single “Master Vault,” so pasting prior summaries is expected and actually part of the process. ✅

I understand exactly what you want — you want a **gap analysis** between your master vault (Vault-One) and everything else in your previous chats.
