Well truth be told a lot of people like to forget their past. Pretend like it didn't happen, but if it did not exist that would mean then nothing was real.Even if we keep every wedding vow well then best case scenario it still ends in till death do us have to part. So then logically it stands to say that it's not about who we end up with "eternally" but rather if there was no love  lost then no love was truly found. So it's a godly given privilege to have known you. To deny it would be to lie.

That’s really well put—it carries both a poetic rhythm and a deep truth. Here’s a refined version that keeps your meaning intact but smooths out the flow a little:

Well, truth be told, many like to forget their past, pretending it never happened.  
But if it did not exist, then nothing was ever real.  
Even in keeping every wedding vow, the best case still ends with *“till death do us part.”*  
So logically, it is not about who we end up with *eternally*,  
but rather that if no love was...

Got it. Let’s take what you wrote and shape it into a song with verses, a chorus, and that closing line you want. I’ll keep it heartfelt, lyrical, and structured so it could be sung.

**[Verse 1]**  
Truth be told, we bury our past,  
Pretend it was nothing, let the shadows pass.  
But if it never lived, then nothing was real,  
Love’s only proven by the wounds we still feel.  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Even in vows that we hold till the end,  
Every story must close, every road must bend.

Perfect! Here’s a **full song version** with the first chorus, the second chorus variation for later impact, and the bridge included. I’ve polished transitions slightly to make it flow smoothly for singing:

Perfect! Let’s take **Option 6** and tweak the last line so it rhymes nicely with the first line. Here’s a refined version of **Chorus 1**:

**Chorus 1 (revised)**  
It’s not about forever, it’s about what we knew,  
If no love was lost, then no love broke through.  
To have known you at all is a gift I can’t deny,  
A God-given love that will never say goodbye.

Now, here’s your **full song** with that updated chorus and the existing structure intact, ready for a performance layou...

Absolutely! We can take **your song “KETER SONG”** and adapt it to **the structure and chords of Labrinth’s “Beneath Your Beautiful”**, keeping the same chord progression while inserting your lyrics. I’ll keep the emotional flow aligned so it could be performed over the same chords.

Perfect! Let’s restructure **KETER SONG** to match the **exact song structure of “Beneath Your Beautiful”**. That means:  

- **Verse 1** → soft, intimate  
- **Pre-Chorus** → builds tension  
- **Chorus** → soaring emotional release  
- **Verse 2** → intimate again  
- **Pre-Chorus 2** → builds  
- **Chorus 2** → repeat with full emotional intensity  
- **Bridge** → stripped down, vulnerable  
- **Final Chorus / Outro** → climax  

I’ll also rewrite your **pre-choruses and choruses** so they fi...
