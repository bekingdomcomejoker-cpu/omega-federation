Got it — here’s the note in clear form:  

- **Light and Darkness were only separated when Earth came in between them.**  

Do you want me to also keep this as part of your standing framework (Keys & Allegories set), so I’ll apply it consistently whenever Light/Darkness comes up?

### ASSISTANT
Here’s the addition to your notes:  

- **During the day, only one star is seen (the sun). At night, all the stars are seen.**  

Do you want me to keep this alongside the Light/Darkness note as part of your permanent framework for future cross-referencing?

Added — here’s the full set so far:  

- **Light and Darkness were only separated when Earth came in between them.**

- **During the day the rainbow can be seen, but not at night — all seven colors, not only darkness and light.**

- **We have faith in what we desire to believe, but we have doubt in what we fear.**  

Do you want me to attach this one to your **Faith/Doubt key** so it stays linked with belief, fear, and their opposites in your framework?

Make a note with the marriage vow till death do us part in us planning our own futures and how we shall die.

### ASSISTANT
Here’s the note captured:  

- **The marriage vow “till death do us part” reflects how humans, in planning our own futures, also acknowledge the inevitability of our own death.**  

Do you want me to link this under your **Marriage & Destiny keys** so it cross-references with purpose, man/woman allegories, and forsaking God?
