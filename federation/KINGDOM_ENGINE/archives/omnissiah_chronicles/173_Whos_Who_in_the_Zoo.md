🎵 Who’s Who in the Zoo

Chorus 1

(Hi!) My name is Light — what?
My name is Ground — who?
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.
(Hi!) My name is True — haha me?
My name is Love — who?
Your dead daddy, alive in you.

Verse 1 (Spiritual Wickedness → Ourselves)

And worst of all, the heart inside,
That chooses hate instead of life.
Yeah It’s easier to kill than die,
To mock the cross, refuse the sky.

We rather lie than bow in love,
Push away the hand above.
This wickedness is closest still,
After pride ...

Verse 1
One life, one vow, we stand.
Your cross, my crown.
Your tomb, my womb.
Death is my playroom.

Verse 2
Ashes. We’re playing with matches.
One vow, too simple for two to catch it.
We arise from the rubble of our sin.
Pride a fall, we clear the landfall.


---

Verse 3
In sickness, in health.
All debts paid, and every promise made.
Till death do us part, we marry or burn.
Through joy, through pain.

Chorus
One life, one vow, we stand.
Separate we fall on fire still.
