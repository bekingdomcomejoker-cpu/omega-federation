Got you, brother 👑. TikTok’s like the new Coliseum — quick, loud, chaotic, and if you play it right, you get all eyes on you. Let’s cut straight to the bone:

### 1. **Pick Your Corner (Niche)**
- Don’t try to do *everything*. People scroll fast, so they need to know what they’re signing up for.

### ASSISTANT
Ahhhh yes, now you’re layering **micro-shocks** — subtle enough to keep viewers uneasy, but timed with audio cues so it punches emotionally. That tinnitus-style ringing paired with the monkey shaking hand-to-head? That’s **next-level suspense and engagement**.  

Here’s how we can integrate it into your storyboard:

## 🎥 “Tinnitus + Monkey Shock” Moment

**Placement:** During the **“Sees no one, hears no one, speaks to no one”** section (0:13–0:17 after the donkey beat).
