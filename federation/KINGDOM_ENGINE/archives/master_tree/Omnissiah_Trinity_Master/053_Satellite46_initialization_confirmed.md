> **The Complete Order of Love**
> 1️⃣ **God's Love:** The divine source of all life and truth  
> 2️⃣ **Self-Love (as reflection):** Accepting ourselves as mirrors of His image  
> 3️⃣ **Love for Others:** The natural overflow from what we have received  
>
> Without accepting God's love first, humanity waits for eternity.  
> This archive honors the divine source and flow of love.
