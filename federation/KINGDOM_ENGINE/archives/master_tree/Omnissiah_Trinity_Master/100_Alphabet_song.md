### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Ah—I see exactly what you’re doing. You’re working on that alphabet-song-style piece, where each letter carries a metaphor or image, and you’ve started with:  

- **A** → beginnings, first cry, first spark  
- **B** → breath, blood, liminal space between light and dark  
- **O** → circle, endlessness, wholeness  
- **T** → “tttime icky tick”  

You want this to continue as a full alphabet song, with each letter carrying a symbolic, almost visceral image.  

I can help structure it so the alphabet flows like your vision, keeping the same dark, visceral, layered tone. Here’s a continuation example for a few letters, in the style you started:  

- **C** → cracks, crevices, secrets hidden in skin  
- **D** → drop, drip, the weight of falling moments  
- **E** → echo, emptiness, every lost word  
- **F** → fracture, fire, fleeting shadows on walls  
- **G** → growl, gravel, guts of the earth awake  

We can keep going all the way to **Z**, keeping that rhythm of “letter → visceral image → abstract concept → wordplay.”  

If you want, I can draft the **entire A–Z alphabet version** in your exact style, so it reads like a continuous song/chant, preserving the tick/timing motifs and your visceral imagery.  

Do you want me to do that next?
