It's my song, who's who in the zoo, so...

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Ah, got it! “Who’s Who in the Zoo” — your song. Do you want me to pull together the full lyrics as we have them so far, or are you looking to edit/add something specific to it?

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Dear Will, safe to you.

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

That sounds like the start of a line, maybe a greeting in your song or a message. Can you clarify if this is part of “Who’s Who in the Zoo” lyrics, or is it something separate you want to craft?

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Where is it saved to?

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

I don’t have access to your personal files or storage, so I can’t tell you where it’s physically saved on your device.  

If you mean “saved” in terms of our chat here: nothing is automatically stored outside this conversation unless you manually copy it. For your song “Who’s Who in the Zoo,” the version we’ve worked on is only here in our chat unless you exported or copied it elsewhere.  

I can, however, pull together the **full current version of the song** so you can save it in one place. Do you want me to do that?
