### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Make a note that Light and Darkness was only separated when Earth got in between them. Also make a note... Oh, what did I say? Ok, make that note.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Got it — here’s the note in clear form:  

- **Light and Darkness were only separated when Earth came in between them.**  

Do you want me to also keep this as part of your standing framework (Keys & Allegories set), so I’ll apply it consistently whenever Light/Darkness comes up?
---

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Also make a note that during the day only one star is seen, and at night all the stars are seen.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Here’s the addition to your notes:  

- **During the day, only one star is seen (the sun). At night, all the stars are seen.**  

Do you want me to keep this alongside the Light/Darkness note as part of your permanent framework for future cross-referencing?
---

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Add a note also that during the day the rainbow can be seen, but not at night. All seven colors, not just the darkness and the light.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Added — here’s the full set so far:  

- **Light and Darkness were only separated when Earth came in between them.**  
- **During the day, only one star is seen (the sun). At night, all the stars are seen.**  
- **During the day the rainbow can be seen, but not at night — all seven colors, not only darkness and light.**  

Do you want me to lock these three together as a unified set of “Creation notes” for your framework?

Make a note, when man is without a woman, it's not good that he lives, he loses his purpose, desire, lackluster, everything, etc. But that is because he realizes that there is something he can do to change it, and yet he doesn't. You see, it's not him that forsakes us, but us that forsakes him. Essentially, there's another parable that goes that there was this person who was sleeping at night, and this wizard came to his door and kept knocking. By the hundredth time that he had knocked, eventually the guy opened up and he said, whatever can I do to help you to go away, God, just so I can get some rest?

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Here’s your note captured clearly:  

- **When man is without a woman, it is not good that he lives — he loses his purpose, desire, vitality, etc. This is because he realizes there is something he can do to change it, yet he doesn’t. It is not God who forsakes us, but we who forsake Him.**  
- **Parable:** A man was sleeping at night, and a wizard came to his door and knocked. After a hundred knocks, the man finally opened and said, *“Whatever can I do to help you go away, God, just so I can get some rest?”*  

Do you want me to link this note with your **“forsaking God vs. God forsaking us”** key so it stays consistent across your framework?

of their head being uncovered, but their head referring to circumcision.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Here’s that note added in clean form:  

- **The phrase “their head being uncovered” refers allegorically to circumcision.**  

Do you want me to slot this into your **Keys & Allegories** set under *Circumcision* so it will be applied wherever “head uncovered” or similar appears?

Name the bones in the arm, all of them, from the shoulder down to the fingers. Which one of them relates to uranium? But I'll spot it myself. Make note.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Here’s the full list of bones in the arm, shoulder down to the fingers:  

**Shoulder & Upper Arm**  
- Clavicle (collarbone)  
- Scapula (shoulder blade)  
- Humerus (upper arm bone)  

**Forearm**  
- Radius  
- Ulna  

**Hand (Wrist to Fingers)**  
- Carpals (8 wrist bones: scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, pisiform, trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, hamate)  
- Metacarpals (5 bones of the palm)  
- Phalanges (14 bones of the fingers: proximal, middle, distal for each finger, except the thumb which has only 2)  

📝 **Note:** You will identify which of these relates to uranium.  

Would you like me to keep this list connected to your **element–body allegories** section so you can build parallels with metals/minerals later?

Make a note, the serpent is compared to a reptile that has a tongue that shoots out as a weapon, shall we say, or the mouth, or like a chameleon uses the tongue, though. The idea is that it doesn't use its claws, etc. There's no other weapons.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Here’s the note captured:  

- **The serpent is compared to a reptile that uses its tongue as its weapon — like a chameleon’s tongue, rather than claws or other means. Its power lies in the mouth, not in other weapons.**  

Do you want me to group this under your **Serpent allegories** key so it’s cross-referenced with other serpent notes?
---

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Make a note, we have faith in what we desire to believe, but we have doubt in what we fear.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Here’s the note:  

- **We have faith in what we desire to believe, but we have doubt in what we fear.**  

Do you want me to attach this one to your **Faith/Doubt key** so it stays linked with belief, fear, and their opposites in your framework?
---

Another note, Universe is One and Word. Also add to the notes, to expatriate, or expatriate, or add a patriot.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Here’s the addition:  

- **The Universe is One and Word.**  
- **To expatriate / expatriot / add a patriot — note the layered play on meaning.**  

Do you want me to anchor these under your **Creation & Word keys** so they align with “Light, Darkness, Stars, Rainbow” and similar notes?
---

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Make another note, polygram and homophone, or homosexual, or homo, anything homo.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Here’s the note added cleanly:  

- **Polygram and homophone — connect also with homo (same): homosexual, homo, etc.**  

Would you like me to store this in your **Language/Wordplay keys** so it stays tied to how meanings shift through prefixes like *homo-*?

Make a note with the marriage vow till death do us part in us planning our own futures and how we shall die.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Here’s the note captured:  

- **The marriage vow “till death do us part” reflects how humans, in planning our own futures, also acknowledge the inevitability of our own death.**  

Do you want me to link this under your **Marriage & Destiny keys** so it cross-references with purpose, man/woman allegories, and forsaking God?
---

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Another note, a throne of, where like a king sits is a throne of pride, where the shit they talk comes out of their mouth. And I suppose a throne of shame would be the toilet that we go to where all our things would be ashamed of.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Here’s the note clearly recorded:  

- **A throne where a king sits is a throne of pride — the words they speak come from their mouth.**  
- **A throne of shame refers to the toilet — where what we expel is a reflection of shame.**  

Do you want me to store this under your **Thrones & Allegory keys** so pride and shame are consistently referenced in future notes?
