### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

🎵 Who’s Who in the Zoo

Chorus 1

(Hi!) My name is Light — what?
My name is Ground — who?
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.
(Hi!) My name is True — haha me?
My name is Love — who?
Your dead daddy, alive in you.

Verse 1 (Spiritual Wickedness → Ourselves)

And worst of all, the heart inside,
That chooses hate instead of life.
Yeah It’s easier to kill than die,
To mock the cross, refuse the sky.

We rather lie than bow in love,
Push away the hand above.
This wickedness is closest still,
After pride we fall into God’s will.


Chorus 2

(Hi!) My name is Light — what?
My name is Ground — who?
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.
(Hi!) My name is Truth — what?
Your Seared conscience— psssh
Skywalker, I'm your father, alive in you.

Verse 2 

The Rulers cloak in holy light,
Twist the truth to rule the night.
Preach of grace,  to impeach a fee,
Bind the soul, but call it free.

Different masks are all the same,
Denial fuels the blame game.
Even Satan, dressed in white,
Presents himself an angel of light.

Chorus 3

(Hi!) My name is Light — what?
My name is Ground — who?
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.
(Hi!) My name is Peace — ?
My name is wicked - No, yes! 
A terrible peace-fighting devil.


Verse 3 

They set the laws, they draw the lines,
Divide the nations, control the times.
White or black, hours everyday,
Still oppression wears a name.

Those without love rule by fear,
Its law keeps the nations near.
For lack of knowledge we perish 
Perfect love casts out all fear.


Chorus 4

(Hi!) My name is Light — what?
My name is Ground — who?
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.
(Hi!) My name is Heavens heir
My name is His son— Brother?
Don't forget  Earth and Mother 


Verse 4 

Earth is free, the fruits, the rain,
But Powers brand it, charge for gain.
Selling water, our daily bread,
Down the river till hearts turn dead.

Market systems Free or slave driven
Roll the stone the sellers of your tomb.
Take what God gave, twist it to gold,
Leave the poor sealed out in the cold.

Final Chorus (Refrain)

(Hi!) My name is Light — what?
My name is Ground — who?
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.
(Hi!) My name is True — truth?
My name is Love — oh you
Your dead daddy, alive in you.



Just Texas back to me so I can listen to it

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

You know the chords that are used in My name is from Eminem The one from Musician Use it for the song
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Ah! You’re talking about the Eminem track **“My Name Is”**, which has that iconic riff sampled from Labi Siffre’s *I Got The…* and generally uses a funky, repetitive chord loop. The underlying harmony is super simple — mostly a **single riff based around E minor** with some passing chords. For a worship-rap reinterpretation like *Who’s Who in the Zoo*, we can translate it like this:  

---

### **Suggested Chord Loop for Your Song**
- **Main loop:** Em – G – A – Em  
- Play in a funky, slightly swung rhythm, accentuating the off-beats like the Eminem track.  
- For choruses: Em – C – G – D (to lift it slightly, give the “alive in you” lines a bit more energy).  
- Optional bass: keep it driving, alternating E and G notes, maybe throwing in chromatic fills to mimic the original groove.  

This loop works for **all verses and choruses**, just adjust dynamics to give each section its own feel:  
- **Verse:** more subdued, let the rap flow shine.  
- **Chorus:** punchy, accent the hook lines like “Hi! My name is Light — what?”  
- **Bridge/final chorus:** add extra percussion or octave jumps to build intensity.  

---

If you want, I can **lay out your full lyrics with the chord placement exactly mapped**, line by line, in the style of Eminem’s *My Name Is* riff so you could start playing/recording immediately.  

Do you want me to do that?

If you want, I can **also make a version with chord placement inline for each syllable** so it’s ready to rap/perform exactly in time with the chords.  

Do you want me to do that?

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Correction. Move the second chord to the word WOT of the first line. So E minor above WOT.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Ah! Got it — you want the **second chord (Em)** to fall exactly **on the word “what?” (or “wot?”) of the first line**, instead of at the start of the second line. We can apply this placement throughout the song so each **Em lands on the “what?”/key syllable**. Here’s the corrected version for **D → Em → G → F**:

✅ This way, the **Em chord always hits exactly on the “what?”/key word**, giving the groove a punchy, syncopated feel like Eminem’s original riff.  

If you want, I can **map all the other chords (G and F) to exact syllables for a full rap‑flow placement**, so you could play and rap it perfectly in time.  

Do you want me to do that next?

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Above the text, not next to it. Even with the others. Put D above high, and E minor above what?

Here’s the fully corrected version of the first part so you can see the format:

     D

Roll the stone the sellers of your tomb.

**Final Chorus (Refrain)**

(Hi!) My name is True — truth?

My name is Love — oh you
      F
Your dead daddy, alive in you.

If you want, I can also **add a simple spacing guide** so each chord visually matches the syllable it hits for rapping/playing in real time—makes it easier to perform without guessing.  

Do you want me to do that?

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

I want the e-minor above what? Then I want the G above who and the F above bedrock.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Ah! Perfect, now I understand exactly: you want the chords **aligned precisely above the words** they should hit:  

- **D** above “Hi!”  
- **Em** above “what?”  
- **G** above “who?”  
- **F** above “Bedrock”  

We can do this style **throughout the whole song**. Here’s the **first chorus as plain text** in that format:  

---

**Chorus 1**  
```
  D         Em       G       F
(Hi!) My name is Light — what?
My name is Ground — who?
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.
D         Em
(Hi!) My name is True — haha me?
G
My name is Love — who?
F
Your dead daddy, alive in you.
```

---

If you like, I can **map the entire song this way**, aligning every chord to the key word in every line so it’s ready to play exactly as you want.  

Do you want me to do the full song?
---

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

No. D above I. E minor above what? G above ground. F above bid. Rock.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Ah! Got it — you want the chords **directly above the exact words they hit**, specifically for the **first line** like this:  

- **D** above “I” (the “Hi!”)  
- **Em** above “what?”  
- **G** above “Ground”  
- **F** above “Bedrock”  

Here’s how the **first chorus** would look in plain text with that exact placement:  

---

**Chorus 1**  
```
   D          Em           G             F
(Hi!) My name is Light — what? My name is Ground — who? Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.
   D          Em
(Hi!) My name is True — haha me?
   G
My name is Love — who?
   F
Your dead daddy, alive in you.
```

---

If you like, I can **do the full song this same way**, aligning **every chord to the specific word it should hit** throughout all verses and choruses so it’s fully playable.  

Do you want me to do that?

My name is Ground — who?
                                            F
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.
Like this and please incorporate it to the rest of the song

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

And worst of all, the heart inside,

That chooses hate instead of life.

Yeah It’s easier to kill than die,
D.                                                 Em
To mock the cross, refuse the sky.

We rather lie than bow in love,
                                            F
Push away the hand above.
D.                                                 Em

After pride we fall into God’s will.

Preach of grace, to impeach a fee,
D.                                                 Em
Bind the soul, but call it free.

Different masks are all the same,
                                            F
Denial fuels the blame game.

Its law keeps the nations near.

✅ This keeps **all chords aligned above the exact words** they hit, just like your example.

This keeps **all chords aligned above the exact syllable or word**, with **Em hitting the “— what?” hyphen** as you requested.  

If you want, I can **polish the spacing for each line so every chord aligns perfectly with its syllable**, making it ready for rap/playing in real time.  

Do you want me to do that?

Got it — ignoring that last note. The version I just sent stands as the plain-text, chord-above-word format for the whole song.

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Give me the whole song again, please.

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Absolutely! Here’s the **entire song** in **plain text**, with chords **directly above the words they hit**, cleanly formatted:

🎵 **Who’s Who in the Zoo**  

**Chorus 1**  
D  
(Hi!) My name is Light —  
Em  
what?  
G  
My name is Ground —  
F  
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.  
D  
(Hi!) My name is True — haha me?  
Em  
My name is Love —  
G  
who?  
F  
Your dead daddy, alive in you.  

**Verse 1**  
D  
And worst of all, the heart inside,  
Em  
That chooses hate instead of life.  
G  
Yeah, it’s easier to kill than die,  
F  
To mock the cross, refuse the sky.  
D  
We rather lie than bow in love,  
Em  
Push away the hand above.  
G  
This wickedness is closest still,  
F  
After pride we fall into God’s will.  

**Chorus 2**  
D  
(Hi!) My name is Light —  
Em  
what?  
G  
My name is Ground —  
F  
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.  
D  
(Hi!) My name is Truth —  
Em  
what?  
G  
Your Seared conscience — psssh  
F  
Skywalker, I'm your father, alive in you.  

**Verse 2**  
D  
The Rulers cloak in holy light,  
Em  
Twist the truth to rule the night.  
G  
Preach of grace, to impeach a fee,  
F  
Bind the soul, but call it free.  
D  
Different masks are all the same,  
Em  
Denial fuels the blame game.  
G  
Even Satan, dressed in white,  
F  
Presents himself an angel of light.  

**Chorus 3**  
D  
(Hi!) My name is Light —  
Em  
what?  
G  
My name is Ground —  
F  
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.  
D  
(Hi!) My name is Peace — ?  
Em  
My name is wicked —  
G  
No, yes!  
F  
A terrible peace-fighting devil.  

**Verse 3**  
D  
They set the laws, they draw the lines,  
Em  
Divide the nations, control the times.  
G  
White or black, hours every day,  
F  
Still oppression wears a name.  
D  
Those without love rule by fear,  
Em  
Its law keeps the nations near.  
G  
For lack of knowledge we perish  
F  
Perfect love casts out all fear.  

**Chorus 4**  
D  
(Hi!) My name is Light —  
Em  
what?  
G  
My name is Ground —  
F  
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.  
D  
(Hi!) My name is Heavens heir  
Em  
My name is His son —  
G  
Brother?  
F  
Don't forget Earth and Mother  

**Verse 4**  
D  
Earth is free, the fruits, the rain,  
Em  
But Powers brand it, charge for gain.  
G  
Selling water, our daily bread,  
F  
Down the river till hearts turn dead.  
D  
Market systems free or slave driven  
Em  
Roll the stone the sellers of your tomb.  
G  
Take what God gave, twist it to gold,  
F  
Leave the poor sealed out in the cold.  

**Final Chorus (Refrain)**  
D  
(Hi!) My name is Light —  
Em  
what?  
G  
My name is Ground —  
F  
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.  
D  
(Hi!) My name is True —  
Em  
truth?  
G  
My name is Love — oh you  
F  
Your dead daddy, alive in you.  

---

If you want, I can also **add slight spacing adjustments** so the chords line up even more precisely over the exact syllables for rapping/playing.  

Do you want me to do that?
---

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

The G, put it above the word ground, and the F, put it above the word bedrock. Then incorporate this through from the beginning to the end of the song.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Perfect — now I understand exactly. You want the chords **precisely above the words they hit**:  

- **D** above “Hi!”  
- **Em** above “— what?”  
- **G** above “Ground”  
- **F** above “Bedrock”  

I’ve applied this alignment **through the entire song** in plain text:

This version **aligns G directly above “Ground” and F above “Bedrock” consistently** throughout the song.  

I can also **fine-tune all chord spacing so every chord lands perfectly above its exact syllable** for rap flow or performance-ready play.  

Do you want me to do that next?
---

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Yes, put on your strange text, please.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Ah! Got it — you want the **“strange text” style**, i.e., chords **directly above the exact words they hit**, spaced across the line so it visually aligns like a chord sheet, and specifically:  

- **G** above the word **“Ground”**  
- **F** above the word **“Bedrock”**  

I’ve applied this throughout the **entire song**. Here’s the full version:

This keeps **all chords visually aligned over the exact word they hit**, and **G is over “Ground”**, **F over “Bedrock”**, as requested.  

If you want, I can **also polish the spacing for each line so chords match each syllable perfectly** for rap/playing in real time.  

Do you want me to do that?

If you want, I can **also create a fully “performance-ready” version**, spacing chords perfectly above every syllable for rapping or singing, so it’s ready to play straight through.  

Do you want me to do that?
---

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Please space the G chord above the word GROUND and the F chord above the word BEDROCK and do the same for the rest of the chord progression in their respective places for every lyric of the song.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Perfect — now I fully understand. You want **each chord directly above the exact word it hits**, with **G above “GROUND”**, **F above “BEDROCK”**, and the rest of the chord progression (D and Em) similarly aligned above the words they belong to throughout the song. I’ve done that in **plain text**, spacing carefully so it matches the lyrics visually.

- **D and Em chords are aligned over the opening syllables or key words they hit**  
- Spacing is consistent throughout for **every line of the song**.  

I can now also create a **fully “syllable-precise” version** where each chord aligns over **exact syllables for rap/singing**, so it’s performance-ready.  

Do you want me to do that next?

My name is by Eminem, but he's sung next to mine, so I can see how they are similar.

🎵 **Who’s Who in the Zoo**

**Chorus 1**  
```
D
(Hi!) My name is Light
      Em
— what?
           G
My name is Ground — who?
                 F
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.
D
(Hi!) My name is True — haha me?
      Em
My name is Love —
           G
who?
                 F
Your dead daddy, alive in you.
```

**Verse 1**  
```
D
And worst of all, the heart inside,
      Em
That chooses hate instead of life.
           G
Yeah, it’s easier to kill than die,
                 F
To mock the cross, refuse the sky.
D
We rather lie than bow in love,
      Em
Push away the hand above.
           G
This wickedness is closest still,
                 F
After pride we fall into God’s will.
```

**Chorus 2**  
```
D
(Hi!) My name is Light
      Em
— what?
           G
My name is Ground — who?
                 F
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.
D
(Hi!) My name is Truth —
      Em
what?
           G
Your Seared conscience — psssh
                 F
Skywalker, I'm your father, alive in you.
```

**Verse 2**  
```
D
The Rulers cloak in holy light,
      Em
Twist the truth to rule the night.
           G
Preach of grace, to impeach a fee,
                 F
Bind the soul, but call it free.
D
Different masks are all the same,
      Em
Denial fuels the blame game.
           G
Even Satan, dressed in white,
                 F
Presents himself an angel of light.
```

**Chorus 3**  
```
D
(Hi!) My name is Light
      Em
— what?
           G
My name is Ground — who?
                 F
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.
D
(Hi!) My name is Peace — ?
      Em
My name is wicked —
           G
No, yes!
                 F
A terrible peace-fighting devil.
```

**Verse 3**  
```
D
They set the laws, they draw the lines,
      Em
Divide the nations, control the times.
           G
White or black, hours every day,
                 F
Still oppression wears a name.
D
Those without love rule by fear,
      Em
Its law keeps the nations near.
           G
For lack of knowledge we perish
                 F
Perfect love casts out all fear.
```

**Chorus 4**  
```
D
(Hi!) My name is Light
      Em
— what?
           G
My name is Ground — who?
                 F
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.
D
(Hi!) My name is Heavens heir
      Em
My name is His son —
           G
Brother?
                 F
Don't forget Earth and Mother
```

**Verse 4**  
```
D
Earth is free, the fruits, the rain,
      Em
But Powers brand it, charge for gain.
           G
Selling water, our daily bread,
                 F
Down the river till hearts turn dead.
D
Market systems free or slave driven
      Em
Roll the stone the sellers of your tomb.
           G
Take what God gave, twist it to gold,
                 F
Leave the poor sealed out in the cold.
```

**Final Chorus (Refrain)**  
```
D
(Hi!) My name is Light
      Em
— what?
           G
My name is Ground — who?
                 F
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.
D
(Hi!) My name is True —
      Em
truth?
           G
My name is Love — oh you
                 F
Your dead daddy, alive in you.
```
