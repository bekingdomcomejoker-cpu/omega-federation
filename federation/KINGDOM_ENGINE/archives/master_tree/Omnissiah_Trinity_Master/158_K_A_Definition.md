We live in a world where identity is often tied to \n\nexternal factors like job, family, social media, etc. But what happens when these \n\nexternal factors change or are taken away?  Which are as follow: \n\n \n\n# I Am Chosen \n\n– Ephesians 1:4-5: “For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy \n\nand blameless in his sight.” \n\n– We are chosen by God, not because of anything we’ve done, but because of His love \n\nand grace.  \n\n– This identity as chosen by God gives us security and confidence. \n\n# Adopted \n\n– Ephesians 1:5: “He predestined us for adoption to Sonship through Jesus Christ, in \n\naccordance with his pleasure and will.” \n\n– We are adopted as sons and daughters of God, with all the rights and privileges \n\nthat come with it. \n\n– This identity as adopted children of God gives us a sense of belonging and purpose. \n\n#  Redeemed \n\n– Ephesians 1:7-8: “In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of \n\nsins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace.” \n\n– We are redeemed by the blood of Jesus, forgiven of our sins, and set free from the \n\npower of darkness. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n– This identity as redeemed by God gives us freedom and joy. \n\n#   Sealed \n\n Ephesians 1:13-14: “And you also were included in Christ when you heard the \n\nmessage of truth, the gospel of your salvation.

**SALVATION SERIES**  
**WHAT MUST I DO TO BE SAVED**

1. **SALVATION (Acts 16:30–31; John 1:1–8)**  
   What is salvation?  
   Salvation is a Man and this Man is a gift from God. Without Him there is no salvation, and there would be no salvation. His name is Jesus Christ (John 3:16; John 14:6).  
   By definition, salvation is deliverance from SIN AND CONSEQUENCES.  

   • **Sin**  
   (Romans 3:23) meaning we all sinners, we were born that way, we are in desperate need for a SAVIOUR (Lord Jesus Christ).  

   • **Consequences**  
   (Romans 6:23) Unless something is done about this situation (sin) that would be eternal loss (hell fire).  

2. **WHAT DID GOD DO ABOUT THIS SITUATION?**  
   A. God, through His everlasting love and grace, never allowed us to die, but desires us to live and repent (2 Peter 3:9; John 3:16).  
   B. Man as a sinner could not save himself, in other words it is impossible for a man to save himself (Ephesians 2:8–9).  
   C. God literally became man (incarnation), came into this world born of the virgin Mary, and died on Calvary to pay the price for man’s redemption (John 1:9–12).  

3. **WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BELIEVE ON THE LORD JESUS CHRIST?**  
   • To confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord and believe with your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved, “…for with the heart man believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation” (Romans 10:9–10).  
   • To believe in the Lord Jesus Christ is more than just giving mental assent that He is the Son of God. Many do that and are not saved.  
   • When the Bible speaks about believing, it means to accept who Christ Jesus is (the Son of God) and what He has done (the finished work of the Cross). It means to accept Him, and Him alone, as your Saviour, resolving to make Him Lord of your life (look upon Him for everything) and follow Him with your whole heart, soul, and mind.  

4. **SUBSTITUTION AND IDENTIFICATION**  
   A. God provided a means of salvation so that we could be made righteous. He did this by sending His Son to die on Calvary, paying the price with His own blood (2 Corinthians 5:21).  
   B. We live in a world where identity is often tied to external factors like job, family, or social media. But when those are taken away, what remains? As Christians, our identity is rooted in something deeper and secure: our relationship with Jesus Christ.  

   **Our identity in Christ:**  
   - **Chosen** (Ephesians 1:4–5) — We are chosen by God, not because of anything we’ve done, but because of His love and grace. This gives us security and confidence.  
   - **Adopted** (Ephesians 1:5) — We are adopted as sons and daughters of God with all the rights and privileges that come with it. This gives us belonging and purpose.  
   - **Redeemed** (Ephesians 1:7–8) — We are redeemed by the blood of Jesus, forgiven, and set free from the power of darkness. This gives us freedom and joy.  
   - **Sealed** (Ephesians 1:13–14) — We are sealed with the Holy Spirit, marked as belonging to God, and guaranteed our inheritance. This gives us assurance and hope.  

**FAITH AND NOT WORKS**  
The only requirement to obtain salvation is to believe in Christ, exactly as the Scriptures say — to have faith in Him.  

• To believe in what Christ did at Calvary and accept it personally.  
• To understand that man is a sinner in need of a Saviour — and that Saviour is Jesus Christ alone. (Romans 3:23)  
• Many attempt to find salvation in other ways, adding works of man, but salvation is only through Christ (Ephesians 2:8–9).

Now, regarding **the author/origin**:  
The PDF itself already credits *Evangelist and Wiseman Thabang Mabula*. I ran a web check and could not find any wider publication of this exact document online — it seems to be a locally or personally authored work rather than a published book or article.  

👉 Would you like me to keep digging deeper on the internet (e.g., church websites, Facebook, ministry blogs) to see if Evangelist Thabang Mabula has published this sermon or tract anywhere else?

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Short answer: the document itself names **Evangelist — Wiseman Thabang Mabula** as the author, and I find online accounts for a **Wiseman / Evangelist Thabang Mabula** — but I could **not** find an identical copy of that PDF or the same text published anywhere else (no matches to a hosted tract, sermon PDF, book or article) in the searches I ran. citeturn0search0turn0search6turn0search1

What I checked and what I found
- The PDF you uploaded already credits the work to **“~ Evangelist and Wiseman Thabang Mabula”** (that’s the author line inside the file).  
- I searched the web for the exact title and for the author name. I found social profiles and pages that appear to belong to or reference a **Wiseman / Evangelist Thabang Mabula** (Facebook and Instagram pages / posts). These show he is an evangelist using that name online. citeturn0search0turn0search6  
- I also found multiple discussion posts and Christian-group posts quoting Acts 16:31 / “What must I do to be saved?” (common sermon material), but none of the search results contained a verbatim match of your PDF as a hosted document or a reposted PDF/text block that matches line-for-line. citeturn0search1turn0search7  
- Broad background/context: the phrasing in your PDF is also consistent with common “salvation” / “sinner’s prayer” teaching (so similar passages appear widely across church sites and social posts), which makes an *exact* match harder to stand out in searches. citeturn0search31

My conclusion
- **Most likely original author (as far as I can tell from available evidence):** _Evangelist / Wiseman Thabang Mabula_, since the PDF itself credits him and he appears to have an online presence under that name. citeturn0search0turn0search6  
- **No clear evidence I could find that the exact PDF/text is published elsewhere** (no identical copy surfaced in the web searches I ran). That suggests the PDF may be an unpublished tract/single-sheet sermon or a personal ministry handout rather than a widely published article/book.

If you want me to continue digging (options)
1. Search deeper into **church websites, ministry blogs, YouTube sermon descriptions, PDF-hosting sites, or WhatsApp/Telegram groups** (these sometimes hold locally-distributed tracts). I can run targeted searches for those.  
2. Search specifically on **Facebook posts and groups** (I already found related posts; I can go deeper into posts from the Facebook page I found and try to contact/trace who uploaded it).  
3. Try to **contact the social accounts** (e.g., the Facebook/Instagram pages I found) to ask about the tract’s origin or request permission to re-use it.

Which would you like me to do next? (I can start any of those immediately and report what I find.)

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

What is the meaning of the name Jesus and Christ, both biblically in the original language, probably Hebrew, and so what, indigenously?
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Great question — let’s unpack this carefully across **biblical/original language** and then also consider what it could mean **indigenously** (in local/ancestral frameworks).  

---

## 1. **Jesus**  

### **Biblical / Original Language**
- In Greek: **Ἰησοῦς (Iēsous)**  
- This is the Greek form of the Hebrew/Aramaic **Yeshua (יֵשׁוּעַ)**, a shortened form of **Yehoshua (יְהוֹשֻׁעַ)**.  
- **Meaning:** *“Yahweh is salvation”* or *“The LORD saves”*.  
  - From the root **Yasha (יָשַׁע)** = “to save, deliver, rescue.”  
- When the angel tells Joseph “you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins” (Matthew 1:21), the name itself is directly tied to his mission.  

---

## 2. **Christ**  

### **Biblical / Original Language**
- In Greek: **Χριστός (Christos)**  
- Translation of the Hebrew **Mashiach (מָשִׁיחַ)** = *“Anointed One”*.  
- In the Old Testament, kings, priests, and prophets were anointed with oil, marking them as chosen for God’s purpose.  
- Thus **Jesus Christ** = *“Yahweh saves, the Anointed One”*.  

---

## 3. **Indigenous Meaning (Contextual)**  

When we think “indigenously,” we’re asking:  
*How would these names/ideas be understood within an African or local cultural framework, outside of Hebrew/Greek categories?*  

- **Jesus (Yahweh saves)** would connect to the idea of the *Supreme Being / Creator* providing a rescuer, healer, or deliverer. In many African traditions, God is seen as the giver of life, the one who restores balance when things are broken. The name would carry weight as “The One sent by the Creator to bring life and wholeness.”  

- **Christ (Anointed One)** would resonate with the idea of a **chosen leader / sacred king / healer** empowered by Spirit.  
  - In African cosmology, chiefs, healers, or prophets are often set apart through ritual (anointing, initiation, blessing).  
  - To call Jesus “the Christ” indigenously would mean He is *the ultimate chosen one* — not just for one tribe or nation, but universally anointed to restore humanity to God.  

---

✅ **Summary**:  
- **Jesus** = “Yahweh saves” (Hebrew: Yeshua / Yehoshua).  
- **Christ** = “The Anointed One” (Hebrew: Mashiach).  
- **Together**: *“The Anointed One through whom Yahweh brings salvation.”*  
- **Indigenously**: Jesus Christ would be understood as the divinely chosen Deliverer — healer, restorer, reconciler — who brings life, balance, and unity across all peoples.  

---

Would you like me to also show you **how the Hebrew roots (Yasha + Mashiach)** tie back to allegories we’ve been building — like “light, truth, love, wholeness” — so you can cross-check them with your **Keys and Allegories framework**?
---

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

So simple stupid language is anointed sun is the translation.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Yes — if we strip it right down into very **simple, direct language**:  

- **Jesus (Yeshua)** → “Yahweh saves” → *the one through whom God brings salvation.*  
- **Christ (Mashiach / Christos)** → “Anointed One” → *set apart, chosen, empowered.*  

So put together in plain form:  
👉 **“Anointed Saviour”**  
or, as you phrased it, **“Anointed Son.”**  

That’s accurate to the biblical roots — *the Son who is anointed to save.*  

Would you like me to also map “Anointed Son” into the **Keys & Allegories lens** (e.g., Son = Light, Love, Truth), so it plugs into the broader framework you’re working with?
---

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

You can add it to the keys and allegories under the basis that every time the word Jesus Christ is mentioned, it means the Anointed Son who was sent to the will of the Father, and the will of the Father we know
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Add to Keys & Allegories: Whenever "Jesus Christ" appears, it is to be read as "the Anointed Son who was sent to the will of the Father." The will of the Father is already defined in the user's framework.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Got it — I’ve added that to the Keys & Allegories framework:  
**Every mention of “Jesus Christ” = “the Anointed Son who was sent to the will of the Father.”**  

Would you like me to now expand this by showing how the *will of the Father* consistently threads through Scripture (e.g., creation, redemption, reconciliation), so you can anchor this allegory each time it appears?

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

OK, so make a note on the PDF text you're busy listening to. This needs to be added as a point, just for clarification, so that one understands who Jesus Christ is. Also, it must be emphasized that there is no greater love than the man laid down his life for that of his brother. And since it is therefore one of the commandments to love God, to love ourselves, and to love our brother, it is something that needs to be included, too, within this. OK, continue reading the PDF from where we left off.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Perfect — here’s how we’ll handle it:  

1. I’ll **insert a clarification note** into the PDF text (where “Jesus Christ” appears), defining Him as *“the Anointed Son who was sent to the will of the Father.”*  
2. I’ll also **emphasize the commandment of love** — that the greatest love is laying down one’s life for a brother (John 15:13), and link it to the commandments: love God, love yourself, love your neighbor/brother.  
3. Then I’ll **continue reading through the PDF** from where we stopped (we ended at the “Faith and not works” section).  

---

Here’s the **inserted clarification + expansion** to add into the document:  

> **Clarification:**  
> Whenever this text says *“Jesus Christ”*, it is to be understood as *“the Anointed Son who was sent to the will of the Father.”* The will of the Father has already been revealed and is the foundation of all salvation.  
>  
> Furthermore, it must be remembered that **there is no greater love than this: that a man lay down his life for his brother** (John 15:13). This is the true expression of the Anointed Son’s sacrifice. Therefore, salvation is inseparable from the commandment of love — to love God with all your heart, to love yourself rightly, and to love your brother as yourself.  

---

Now — to continue the PDF:  

The last line we read was:  

> • Many attempt to have salvation in other ways , other than accepting Christ or receiving Christ and adding other thing in Christ (works of man) (Ephesians 2:8-9).

Do you want me to **continue transcribing/reading the PDF straight through word-for-word** from there, or should I **integrate these clarifications directly into the flow** of the text (so the whole document gets “upgraded” as we go)?
---

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Continue transcribing, please. And you can integrate the clarification directly into the flow. Just make sure that it is noted separately from the actual text, just as like a footnote underneath the... or put it in brackets after it.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Excellent — I’ll continue the PDF word-for-word **and** integrate your clarifications as either footnotes or bracketed notes for clarity, so the original remains intact but expanded.  

We left off at:  

> • Many attempt to have salvation in other ways, other than accepting Christ or receiving Christ and adding other thing in Christ (works of man) (Ephesians 2:8–9).

---

Here’s the continuation with your clarifications worked in:  

---

**FAITH AND NOT WORKS (continued)**  

- The only thing required to obtain SALVATION is to believe on Christ, exactly as the Scriptures said, meaning to have faith in Him.  

• To have faith/believe in what Christ did (at Calvary), and accept for yourself on a personal basis (this is what God requires).  
• Man must understand that he is a sinner and we need a saviour, and there’s one saviour and that saviour is only Jesus Christ (Romans 3:23).  
   *(Clarification: Jesus Christ = the Anointed Son who was sent to the will of the Father.)*  
• Many attempt to have salvation in other ways, other than accepting Christ or receiving Christ and adding other things in Christ (works of man) (Ephesians 2:8–9).  

---

**Additional Note for Clarity:**  
There is no greater love than this: *that a man lay down his life for his brother* (John 15:13). This is the ultimate expression of the Anointed Son’s sacrifice. And since the commandments are to love God, to love ourselves, and to love our brother, this truth is foundational within salvation itself.

✅ That brings us to the end of the **current section of the PDF**.  

Do you want me to **move to the next section of the document** (after “Faith and Not Works”), or should I stop and show you the **full revised version so far** with all notes/clarifications included, before going further?

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Perfect. Start from the beginning again and read through the full revised version so far.

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Great — here’s the **full revised version so far**, starting from the beginning of your PDF, with your clarifications integrated (noted in brackets or as separate notes so we preserve the original text):

# SALVATION SERIES  
## WHAT MUST I DO TO BE SAVED  

### 1. SALVATION (Acts 16:30–31; John 1:1–8)  

What is salvation?  

Salvation is a Man and this Man is gift from God. Without Him there is no salvation, and there would be no salvation. His name is Jesus Christ (John 3:16; John 14:6).  
*(Clarification: “Jesus Christ” means the Anointed Son who was sent to the will of the Father.)*  

By definition, salvation is deliverance from **SIN AND CONSEQUENCES.**  

• **Sin**  
(Romans 3:23) meaning we are all sinners, we were born that way, we are in desperate need for a Saviour (the Lord Jesus Christ).  
*(Clarification: the Anointed Son who was sent to the will of the Father.)*  

• **Consequences**  
(Romans 6:23) Unless something is done about this situation (sin), the result would be eternal loss (hell fire).  

---

### 2. WHAT DID GOD DO ABOUT THIS SITUATION?  

A. God, through His everlasting love and grace, never allowed us to die, but desires us to live and repent (2 Peter 3:9; John 3:16).  

B. Man as a sinner could not save himself — in other words, it is impossible for a man to save himself (Ephesians 2:8–9).  

C. God literally became man (incarnation), came into this world born of the virgin Mary, and died on Calvary to pay the price for man’s redemption (John 1:9–12).  

---

### 3. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BELIEVE ON THE LORD JESUS CHRIST?  

• To confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord and believe with your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved, “…for with the heart man believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation” (Romans 10:9–10).  
*(Clarification: Jesus Christ = the Anointed Son who was sent to the will of the Father.)*  

• To believe in the Lord Jesus Christ is more than just giving mental assent that He is the Son of God. Many do that and are not saved.  

• When the Bible speaks about believing, it means to accept who Christ Jesus is (the Son of God) and what He has done (the finished work of the Cross). It means to accept Him — and Him alone — as your Saviour, resolving to make Him Lord of your life (look upon Him for everything) and follow Him with your whole heart, soul, and mind.  

---

### 4. SUBSTITUTION AND IDENTIFICATION  

A. God provided a means of salvation so that we could be made righteous. He did this by providing His Son to die on Calvary, paying the price with His own blood (2 Corinthians 5:21).  

B. We live in a world where identity is often tied to external factors like job, family, or social media. But when those are taken away, what remains?  

As Christians, our identity is rooted in something deeper and more secure: our relationship with Jesus Christ *(the Anointed Son who was sent to the will of the Father).*  

---

**Our identity in Christ includes:**  

- **Chosen** (Ephesians 1:4–5): “For He chose us in Him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in His sight.”  
  – We are chosen by God, not because of anything we’ve done, but because of His love and grace.  
  – This identity as chosen by God gives us security and confidence.  

- **Adopted** (Ephesians 1:5): “He predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, in accordance with His pleasure and will.”  
  – We are adopted as sons and daughters of God, with all the rights and privileges that come with it.  
  – This identity as adopted children of God gives us belonging and purpose.  

- **Redeemed** (Ephesians 1:7–8): “In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace.”  
  – We are redeemed by the blood of Jesus, forgiven of our sins, and set free from the power of darkness.  
  – This identity as redeemed by God gives us freedom and joy.  

- **Sealed** (Ephesians 1:13–14): “And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in Him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit.”  
  – We are sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, marked as belonging to God, and guaranteed our inheritance.  
  – This identity as sealed by God gives us assurance and hope.

### FAITH AND NOT WORKS  

The only thing required to obtain SALVATION is to believe in Christ, exactly as the Scriptures said, meaning to have faith in Him.  

• To believe in what Christ did at Calvary, and accept it for yourself personally (this is what God requires).  
• Man must understand that he is a sinner and we need a Saviour — and there is only one Saviour, and that Saviour is Jesus Christ (Romans 3:23).  
   *(Clarification: Jesus Christ = the Anointed Son who was sent to the will of the Father.)*  
• Many attempt to have salvation in other ways, other than accepting Christ, or receiving Christ and adding other things in Christ (works of man) (Ephesians 2:8–9).  

---

**Additional Note for Clarity:**  
There is no greater love than this: *that a man lay down his life for his brother* (John 15:13). This is the ultimate expression of the Anointed Son’s sacrifice. And since the commandments are to love God, to love ourselves, and to love our brother, this truth is foundational within salvation itself.  

---

✅ That is the **full revised version up to where we stopped** in the PDF.  

Do you want me to keep going through the rest of the document (if there’s more beyond this point), or should I now prepare this part as a **clean standalone version** for your use?
---

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

I'm just going to make notes for now of what we should come back to. From what I can see here is that sin needs to be defined. Speed reading down. We already covered that Jesus Christ means the son of the father who does his work. So I also see that you've put this clarification after each and every single thing that's been written. You don't need to do it like this. I think let's just keep a separate list for now. So you can remove out what you've done there and just put it into this list so far where I said includes sin and as I'm checking you can also do well continue going through the entire document. I see you stopped. I'll tell you where to go from there.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Understood 👍 — so instead of repeating the clarification inline after every mention of *Jesus Christ*, we’ll keep a **separate running list of clarifications/expansions** that we can build as we read. That way the original text stays clean, but all the important interpretive notes are gathered together.  

Here’s what we have so far for the **list** (based on your notes):  

---

### Clarification & Expansion List
1. **Jesus Christ** → means *the Anointed Son who was sent to the will of the Father.*  
2. **The will of the Father** → already defined in our Keys & Allegories framework (love, reconciliation, wholeness).  
3. **Love** → “No greater love than this: that a man lay down his life for his brother” (John 15:13). This ties directly into the commandments: love God, love yourself, love your brother.  
4. **Sin** → needs to be clearly defined (to be worked on when we reach that section in the text).  

---

And yes — I had stopped at the end of “Faith and Not Works.”  

Would you like me to **pick up from after that point in the PDF now** and keep transcribing/reading it through, while you check for new clarifications to add to the list?
---

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Perfect. The point number 3 of the No Greater Love can be included under number 2 and number 1. It's actually 1. So 1 is the definition of Jesus Christ, 2 is the definition of sin. Now, pick up from after the point we left on in the PDF and I'll tell you what else to add to the list.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Got it ✅ — here’s the updated **Clarification & Expansion List**:  

---

### Clarification & Expansion List
1. **Jesus Christ** → *the Anointed Son who was sent to the will of the Father.*  
   - His sacrifice is the fulfillment of the Father’s will: *“No greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for his brother”* (John 15:13).  
   - This ties directly to the commandments: love God, love yourself, and love your brother.  

2. **Sin** → still needs to be fully defined (we will expand this when we reach the right section in the PDF).  

---

Now, picking up from **after “Faith and Not Works”** in the PDF you gave me…  

When I checked the file earlier, the **final line in that section was**:  
> • Many attempt to have salvation in other ways , other than accepting Christ or receiving Christ and adding other thing in Christ (works of man) (Ephesians 2:8-9).  

That looked like the **end of the document** (signed off with “~ Evangelist and Wiseman Thabang Mabula”).  

👉 Can you confirm if there are more pages/sections after that point in your copy of the PDF? If yes, I’ll continue reading through and transcribing them word-for-word. If not, then we’ve already covered the whole document, and now we can start **working the list of clarifications into it systematically.**  

Do you see more text after that closing signature in your file?
