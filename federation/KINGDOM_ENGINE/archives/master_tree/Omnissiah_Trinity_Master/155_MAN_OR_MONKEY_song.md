### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

I'm going to paste the text into here, but basically this is our idea for a song that I want to write. This is the basic simple story of it. So we asked to... something, a thought on the outside asked us to ask, what are we, where are we, and then all we do is we ask where are we, and then we tell him we're in a sea, everywhere of knowledge, there's a whole bunch of stuff, well we can't swim, and then he tells us where are you, no there's whales and there's sharks and what not. Then eventually she shows us, we realise that we're on land, so he takes the water away. Then when we're on land, there's these nameless fields and the trees again, and then what we do is we say, no, this one's, that's a tree, that one, that one's, that one's, that's a sheep, that's a sheep, no we can't sheep when we sleep, I think sacrifice cows in the day, and I don't know. So after that we say, okay fine. He takes us back now this time to the water. No, no, no, this time he takes us to the centre of the earth, right to the middle of it. This time things start getting really hot, shall we say. It gets hot, and what happens when you add, if you add water to soil then things grow, it becomes mud though. If you add air to soil, that's great, but it just blows around a lot though, and then not much grows. If you add, what's that element? But if you add fire though to ground, well then it turns into glass and you can see your reflection. And once seeing himself he realised, wait, I'm not a monkey, I'm a man.

And how this echoes the creation story I was a story as he created the earth around us with the water and the timeline of coming out of the waters and everything and also our birth coming out of our physical mothers and their timeline as well the corporated into this from not just the water but this is the air and the well we really work around so because only you have added fire

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Got it — you’ve basically given me a creation-myth-slash-hero’s-journey that’s begging to be turned into a layered, poetic song.  
Here’s how I’d break what you wrote into a **clear concept** you can build lyrics around:

---

### **Core Storyline (Song Narrative)**  
1. **The Call to Question**  
   - An external “voice” asks: *“What are you? Where are you?”*  
   - We (the narrator/people) only answer *“Where are we?”* — we don’t yet know what we are.  

2. **The Sea of Knowledge**  
   - We’re in a vast sea full of whales and sharks (truths and dangers).  
   - We can’t swim; we’re overwhelmed by knowledge.  

3. **Revealing the Land**  
   - “She” (Wisdom/Spirit) shows us the land.  
   - The waters recede.  
   - We’re on nameless fields, with nameless trees and creatures.  

4. **Naming**  
   - We start naming: *“That’s a tree… that’s a sheep…”*  
   - The Adam moment. Identity + language.  

5. **Descent to the Center**  
   - Now we’re taken down to the earth’s core — it’s hot.  
   - We experiment:  
     - Soil + water = mud (life but messy).  
     - Soil + air = dust (movement but no growth).  
     - Soil + fire = glass (reflection).  

6. **Self-Realization**  
   - In the glass, we see our reflection.  
   - Realization: *“I’m not a monkey; I’m a man.”*  
   - We’ve gone from unformed, unnamed, overwhelmed, to self-aware and standing.  

7. **The Echo of Creation**  
   - This parallels:  
     - Genesis (water, land, naming, man).  
     - Birth (water → air → life → consciousness).  
     - Alchemy (earth, water, air, fire → transformation).  

---

### **Song Hook / Theme Idea**
> *“Out of the waters, through nameless fields,  
> Down to the fire where the glass reveals…  
> I’m not a monkey, I’m a man.”*

This line would make a killer **chorus** or **refrain**.  

---

### **Structure Suggestion**
- **Verse 1** – The voice & the sea of knowledge (whales, sharks, can’t swim).  
- **Pre-Chorus** – “She shows us land / waters fade from our hands…”  
- **Chorus** – The reflection / realization hook (“I’m not a monkey, I’m a man”).  
- **Verse 2** – Naming the fields and creatures.  
- **Bridge** – The descent to the core; earth + elements experiment.  
- **Final Chorus** – Full realization + rebirth.  

---

### **Style**
This story could work in a mystical/folk-rock style (think Peter Gabriel’s *“In Your Eyes”* vibe with Genesis-like lyrics) or even progressive metal (Tool / Mastodon style) because of its heavy imagery.

---

Would you like me to **draft an actual first version of the lyrics** (using your imagery exactly but set to a structured verse/chorus format)? Or do you want me to keep refining the **storyboard** first before we write?

We can echo this into the song as well, or incorporate it into it, should I say. And then, while we were working so hard, six days a week, we fell asleep and then we just started counting everyone as sheep. And then, this is almost the same way as, when dying, Jesus said to John, Behold, brother, your son, son, your mother.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Ah — now you’re layering **labor, exhaustion, and human identity** into the creation story. This gives the song a really strong **moral and spiritual echo**: the “six days of work” mirrors Genesis’ workweek, and the sleep + counting as sheep ties into **both human fallibility and Jesus’ teachings**.  

Here’s how we could incorporate that into your existing structure:

---

### **Integration Ideas**

1. **Six Days of Work → Human Struggle**
   - After naming the fields and creatures, we show human toil: *working six days a week, falling asleep exhausted*.  
   - While asleep, humans **fail to see clearly**, and begin seeing each other as sheep — a metaphor for conformity, obedience, or lost individuality.

2. **Sheep & Sacrifice Echo**
   - The counting of sheep ties directly to the naming/Adam motif and also subtly foreshadows sacrifice.  
   - Could link to the **Jesus/John reference**, where care and relational responsibility are emphasized: even when exhausted, there’s accountability and care (*“Behold, your son; son, your mother”*).

3. **Musical Placement**
   - This could be a **bridge or interlude**, where the tempo slows, creating a reflective, almost hypnotic moment while the “sheep” imagery plays.  
   - Then it resolves back into the **fire/glass/self-realization sequence**, showing humans emerging from both labor and sleep into consciousness.

---

### **Lyric Concept (Draft Snippet)**

> Six days we labored, hands to the ground,  
> Counting sheep while the world spun around.  
> Dreams of obedience, shadows of care,  
> “Behold your brother, your mother, beware.”  

This keeps the spiritual echo without making it too literal, but it ties your song thematically to **labor, fallibility, and revelation**.

---

If you want, I can **merge all the story elements so far** — sea, land, naming, descent, fire, sheep, Jesus echo — into a **single cohesive song draft**. That would give you the full narrative in one place.  

Do you want me to do that next?

So, while in the fires of hell, that we were taken to, we ended up getting a phone. Because there was no water, you know, they were all hanging in the tree, up in the trees, transpiring. And the air was toxic, since it was filled with smoke. You couldn't see anything or breathe the air. But in this phone, which was our device of communication, we had a screen and a camera in the centre of it, the eye in the middle, staring back at us to reveal.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

🔥 Now you’re adding a *brilliantly dark* turn to the narrative — almost like an **apocalyptic or dystopian parable** embedded in the creation journey. This works because it’s basically the “Sheol/hell” descent of the hero: once you’ve named the world and labored in it, you’re dragged down into its consequences, and that’s where the revelation actually happens.

Here’s how that new imagery slots in with what you already have:

---

### **Expanded Story Arc**

1. **Sea → Land → Naming → Work**  
   - All the original stages we mapped.

2. **Descent into the Fire (Hell)**  
   - No water left — it’s all *transpiring* into the trees above.  
   - The air is toxic and full of smoke — you can’t breathe or see.  
   - This is the “hell” of your myth; humans at their limit.  

3. **The Phone (Modern Forbidden Fruit)**  
   - In the middle of the hellfire there’s a *device of communication* — a phone.  
   - It’s our only connection — but also our mirror.  
   - The screen and camera become the “eye in the middle” — echoing the all-seeing eye, the self, and the tree of knowledge at the same time.  

4. **The Revelation**
   - Looking into the camera we see ourselves.  
   - It’s the final reflection moment — “the glass” you mentioned earlier, but now high-tech and sinister.  
   - We realize who we are… and who we’re not.  

---

### **Lyric Sketch for This Section (Bridge / Second Bridge)**

> Down in the furnace, where the water’s gone dry,  
> Trees hold their secrets, transpiring to sky.  
> Air turned to poison, smoke thick as a veil,  
> We found a device in the depths of our hell.  
>  
> A screen in the centre, an unblinking eye,  
> Reflecting our faces, no place to hide.  
> The eye in the middle, the mirror revealed,  
> The fire was glass and the glass was our seal.  

---

This ties perfectly to your earlier **earth + elements** sequence (soil + fire = glass), except now the “glass” is a *screen*, and the reflection is literal. It’s a killer metaphor for technology as the modern mirror of the soul.

Do you want me to go ahead and **stitch everything so far** into a single, full draft of the song (with verses, choruses, bridge, etc.)? It would give you a big, dramatic, unified piece to work from.
