### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Ah! This map is a fascinating representation of **classical African indigenous civilizations before significant Asiatic or European contact** (200,000 BCE–350 BCE). You asked about genealogy—so let’s break this down:

1. **Kemet & Kush** (Egypt and Nubia/Sudan region)  
   - Kemet is the ancient Egyptian civilization.  
   - Kush was the Nubian kingdom south of Egypt, heavily interlinked through trade, intermarriage, and conquest.  
   - Genealogically, Nubians and Egyptians share significant ancestry, and some royal lines intermarried.

2. **Punt** (Horn of Africa / parts of modern-day Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, and Sudan)  
   - Puntites were traders with Kemet.  
   - Often referenced in Egyptian texts as bringing exotic goods like incense and gold.  
   - Genetically, they likely shared Nilotic and Cushitic roots with Nubians and early Ethiopians.

3. **Toubou** (Chad, Central Sahara) & **Tehenu** (Libya / Eastern North Africa)  
   - Nomadic or semi-nomadic Saharan peoples.  
   - Likely shared common ancestors with early Saharan civilizations and Berber populations (Gnawa, Numidia).

4. **Wagadu / Mandé / Songhai / Hausa / Nok / Ife / Akan** (West Africa)  
   - These were West African civilizations that contributed to Mandé, Yoruba, and other lineages.  
   - Genealogically, they are ancestors to many modern West African ethnic groups.  
   - Nok culture (Nigeria) is known for early ironworking and terracotta sculpture.

5. **San & Mwari-Nguni** (Southern Africa)  
   - San (Bushmen) are among the oldest continuous human lineages, hunter-gatherers with a highly distinct genetic profile.  
   - Nguni-speaking Bantu groups later migrated south, mixing with Khoisan peoples in some areas.

6. **Twa / Luba-Bemba / Nambi / Himba** (Central & Southern Africa)  
   - Twa: Pygmy hunter-gatherers.  
   - Luba-Bemba: Early Central African kingdoms, proto-Bantu-speaking.  
   - Himba / Nambi: Southern Namibian and Angolan pastoralists; closely related to Bantu migration lines.

7. **Gnawa / Numidia / Medjay** (North Africa)  
   - Numidia: Berber tribes (Algeria / Tunisia).  
   - Medjay: Nubian-Saharan people referenced by Egyptians as police/warriors.  
   - Gnawa: Berber descendants with sub-Saharan ancestry through trade and migration.

**Genealogical insight:**  
This map essentially illustrates **the spread of early African ethnic groups, proto-languages, and civilizations**, many of which contributed to the genetic and cultural ancestry of modern African populations. You can see the roots of Nilotic, Cushitic, Berber, Bantu, and Khoisan genealogical lines clearly mapped.  

If you want, I can make a **simplified “genealogy tree” connecting these civilizations to modern African ethnic groups**, which might make it easier to visualize their ancestral lines. Do you want me to do that?
