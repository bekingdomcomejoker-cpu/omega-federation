### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Not really you going to love it loves this best song,fee changes I want to make in it there I'm going to copy pasted you

Notice the deflections, the facts
And lies around the true situation
The personal attacks the threats
Of sin and eternal living damnation


You see, the truth stands strong
Walks alone no supporting army
Doesn't need to silence any fool
It doesn't need a smear campaign


If your love was found to be true 
Why feel the need to fight so hard
My heart and soul was already yours
Why enslave my body to your will 


For hours bring facts, 1 to twelve
Charging lies rush ahead in seconds
And I know it's taking a little longer
A lie spoken in due season and time

All we got is love, time telling truth
Ticked off we're sure we're going 
about it the right way every second
Every minute every hour every day


And then when the truth finally does come out,
just look out for those negligent reactions,
the emotional responses, the personal attacks.
And ask yourself again,

Our love running out fracturing time 
Shadows Lines drawn in the sand 
You see, the truth doesn't need an army.
all the truth needs is a little more time.

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

This is actually a strong foundation — it’s raw, defiant, and poetic in the way it calls out hypocrisy and control. It already has the bones of something powerful. What I’ll do is keep your lines intact but tighten them up a little, clean the rhythm, make the images sharper, and give it a flow so it can sit over a beat without losing its meaning.  

Here’s a refined version with your original intent preserved but more impact:  

---

**Verse 1**  
Notice the deflections, the twisted facts,  
The lies wrapped ‘round the truth like traps.  
Personal attacks, threats on my salvation,  
Sin and damnation as your foundation.  

**Pre-Chorus**  
But the truth stands tall, it walks alone,  
No army behind it, it stands on its own.  
Doesn’t silence fools, doesn’t smear a name,  
Truth doesn’t play that power game.  

**Chorus**  
If your love was real, if it was true,  
Why fight so hard for what was already you?  
My heart, my soul were freely given —  
Why enslave my body, cage my living?  

**Verse 2**  
Hours drag with facts, one through twelve,  
While lies rush forward, bold and unwell.  
I know the truth takes time to unfold,  
A lie’s quicksilver, but truth is gold.  

**Bridge**  
All we’ve got is love, and time’s telling truth,  
Tick by tick, second by second, proof.  
Every minute, every hour, every day,  
We swear we’re right — but time will say.  

**Outro**  
And when the truth comes out at last,  
Watch the panic, the shadows cast —  
The rage, the tears, the attacks and spin,  
Ask yourself: where’s love in this sin?  

Our love’s run thin, fracturing time,  
Shadows and lines drawn in the sand.  
Truth needs no army, no command —  
All it needs… is a little more time.  

---

It keeps all your themes:
- **Truth vs Lies** → the slow burn of truth vs the rush of lies.  
- **Love vs Control** → you already gave them your soul but they wanted your body.  
- **Time** → truth takes time, lies are instant.  

Would you like me to make it lean more toward *spoken word/poetry vibe* (slam poetry style) or *song/lyric vibe* (verse/chorus/bridge)? I can push it fully in either direction.

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

I want you to incorporate also finger pointing. Play on the words finger painting. When we point fingers, it's the same as love pointing, as drawing lines in the sand. You know where I'm going with this. Don't interpret my words exactly. I'm just giving you ideas to write into this. Thank you for watching.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Got it — I see exactly where you’re aiming. You want **finger pointing** flipped on its head, turned into **finger painting**, where accusations and blame become strokes of a brush — drawing lines in the sand, sketching out love or hate. Instead of making it literal, we weave it in as a metaphor so it slides naturally into your truth vs. lies, love vs. control framework.  

Here’s a reworked version with those textures layered in:  

---

**Verse 1**  
Notice the deflections, the twisted facts,  
Finger pointing like colors splashed black.  
Accusations brushed across the sky,  
Finger painting shadows — but truth won’t die.  

**Pre-Chorus**  
The truth walks steady, alone and untamed,  
Needs no army, needs no campaign.  
Doesn’t silence fools or smear a name,  
It doesn’t paint with guilt or shame.  

**Chorus**  
If your love was real, if it was true,  
Why fight so hard for what was already you?  
My heart, my soul were freely given —  
Why enslave my body, cage my living?  

**Verse 2**  
Hours move slow with facts laid bare,  
Lies rush ahead with a careless flare.  
Each finger stroke draws a crooked line,  
But truth sketches patience, given time.  

**Bridge**  
Finger pointing or finger painting — it’s the same hand,  
Drawing lines, carving shadows in the sand.  
Is it blame you’re tracing, or love you’re creating?  
Time decides what picture we’re making.  

**Outro**  
And when truth comes out, raw and unframed,  
Watch the smears, the tantrums, the names.  
But love doesn’t fracture, it holds the design —  
Truth doesn’t need armies, just a little more time.  

---

This way, “finger pointing / finger painting” becomes an image of how people try to **paint their version of reality** — but the truth’s canvas stays intact.  

Want me to sharpen it even further so that the **finger painting metaphor** runs like a red thread through the whole song, not just a few key places? That would give it an even tighter concept.
---

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Yes, exactly, but we're painting with blood.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

🔥 Now that’s the punch — finger painting not with harmless colors, but **with blood**, with the cost of love, betrayal, sacrifice, and truth written in red. That makes it way heavier, way more prophetic. Here’s a tightened version that weaves **blood-painting** all through the imagery:  

---

**Verse 1**  
Notice the deflections, the twisted facts,  
Finger pointing, red stains on the tracks.  
Every accusation paints the ground,  
Blood on the canvas, truth still bound.  

**Pre-Chorus**  
But truth walks steady, unarmed, alone,  
Needs no army, no kingdom, no throne.  
Doesn’t silence fools, doesn’t smear a name —  
It doesn’t paint with guilt or shame.  

**Chorus**  
If your love was real, if it was true,  
Why fight so hard for what was already you?  
My heart, my soul were freely given —  
Why enslave my body, cage my living?  

**Verse 2**  
Hours crawl slow, twelve marks on the wall,  
Lies race ahead, spilling crimson gall.  
Finger painting lines across the sand,  
Red rivers drawn by trembling hands.  

**Bridge**  
Finger pointing or finger painting — it’s the same hand,  
Sketching blame, love, or loss in the sand.  
But when it’s painted in blood, the truth won’t fade,  
Every stroke a scar, every scar a blade.  

**Outro**  
When truth breaks out, unveiled in time,  
Watch the panic, the rage, the frantic signs.  
But love doesn’t fracture, it bleeds and refines —  
Truth needs no army, just blood on the lines.  

---

This makes **blood = ink/paint**, so every false accusation, every “line in the sand,” is written in blood. It doubles as **sacrifice** and **violence** — you can’t wash it away.  

Do you want me to lean it more toward **prophetic/apocalyptic tone** (like Revelation-style blood imagery) or keep it **personal/intimate** (love, betrayal, scars)?
---

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

It's perfect as is, don't change it. But I would like to incorporate from what I've seen to you the way that I was trying to explain the clock and how all we have is time running out to love and seconds, for hours we spend talking facts and then for seconds charge ahead, that line, I want to include that. Because you can play off on the words minute and minute too. Please try to write me a line with that, four lines.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Got you — I’ll lace that **time/clock imagery** into a four-line block that could slot right into your existing song. I’ll play on *minute* (tiny/small) and *minute* (time), and tie it to the idea of truth vs. lies moving at different speeds.  

Here’s a four-liner:  

---

For hours we argue, stacking facts in line,  
But seconds charge ahead, reckless by design.  
A minute detail, or a minute to decide,  
Love’s running out — and time won’t hide.  

---

Would you like me to draft a couple of alternate four-line options with different emphases (one more poetic, one more raw) so you can pick the flavor that fits best in the song?
---

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

All we got is love, time telling truth
Ticked off we're sure we're going 
about it the right way every second
Every minute every hour every day
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Perfect — that section you wrote already hits the clock imagery. Let me polish it into a **tight, lyrical 4-line stanza** that keeps your intent, but folds in the double meaning of *minute/minute* and the sense of time running out:  

---

All we’ve got is love, and time to prove,  
Tick by tick, it’s truth that moves.  
Every second, every minute — both minute and vast,  
Every hour, every day — love fading fast.  

---

That keeps the heartbeat rhythm, keeps it singable, and sharpens the **time/love tension**.  

Want me to try a version where “minute/minute” is even more obvious, almost like a wordplay punchline in the stanza?
---

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Let's incorporate the word tick. Like a tick that bites, like lives on a dog, you know that one? Tick and, uh, bite. On you. Something like that.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

🔥 Nice — that’s exactly the kind of layered metaphor that makes a lyric cut deeper. “Tick” as **time passing**, but also as a **parasite that bites and drains** — tying in to lies, control, or even love turned toxic. Here’s a four-line stanza that blends the two:  

---

All we got is love, but time still ticks,  
Biting like a parasite, feeding off the mix.  
Every second it drains, every moment it feeds,  
Truth bleeds through where the body bleeds.  

---

Do you want me to push it more toward the **dark/raw parasite imagery** (tick = feeding on love), or keep it **subtle and poetic** (tick = time biting softly at us)?
---

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

I'm thinking actually of... Let's take what I said you, where you said I had got it in the clock imagery right. Maybe we should just incorporate that into this song that we've already done here. And then I will take now this tick metaphor and move it to another song immediately.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

That’s a sharp call — keep this one **clean with the clock/time/love imagery** (it’s already tight and powerful), and save the **tick/parasite bite** idea for a darker, heavier song where it can carry its own weight.  

So for *this* song, I’d suggest we just **drop your “All we got is love, time telling truth” stanza** straight into the version we already finalized, right after the second verse or before the bridge — it’ll flow perfectly.  

Here’s how it slots in:  

---

**Verse 2**  
Hours crawl slow, twelve marks on the wall,  
Lies race ahead, spilling crimson gall.  
Finger painting lines across the sand,  
Red rivers drawn by trembling hands.  

**Inserted Stanza (your clock imagery)**  
All we got is love, time telling truth,  
Ticked off we’re sure we’re going the right route.  
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day —  
But love keeps slipping, ticking away.  

**Bridge**  
Finger pointing or finger painting — it’s the same hand,  
Sketching blame, love, or loss in the sand.  
But when it’s painted in blood, the truth won’t fade,  
Every stroke a scar, every scar a blade.  

---

This way the “time/love” piece becomes the hinge before the bridge.  

👉 Then, the **tick/bite/parasite metaphor** we set aside can become the seed for the next track — a grittier one, where the image won’t get diluted.  

Want me to sketch out how that “tick song” could open so you’ve got a fresh start ready for it?
