### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

There are three that testify, the baptism, the resurrection, and what's the third one?
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

You’re referring to **1 John 5:7–8**, which in the biblical context talks about three that testify. Carefully examining the passage:  

> “For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree as one.”

In many interpretations, especially in modern translations, the earthly testimony is emphasized:  

1. **The Spirit** – representing the ongoing work of God in the believer’s life.  
2. **The Water** – symbolic of **baptism**.  
3. **The Blood** – symbolizing **the death/resurrection of Christ**.  

So if you are looking at your phrasing:  

- **Baptism** → Water  
- **Resurrection** → Blood  
- **Third** → **The Spirit**  

✅ The three that testify together are **the Spirit, the water (baptism), and the blood (resurrection of Christ)**.  

If you want, I can break down exactly how each “testimony” connects spiritually and biblically for a deeper understanding. Do you want me to do that?

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Saved for, for a purpose, is useful.
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Exactly — that’s a profound spiritual principle. In essence:  

- Being **saved** isn’t just about personal deliverance; it’s about being **set aside for a purpose**.  
- The “purpose” is often tied to **service, bearing fruit, and fulfilling God’s will** in the world.  
- Usefulness comes from aligning with that purpose — a saved life that does not serve or bless others is like a tool left unused.  

In biblical terms, this aligns with passages like:  

- **Ephesians 2:10** – “For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.”  
- **1 Peter 2:9** – “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people, that you may declare the wonderful deeds of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.”  

So salvation **carries a calling** — it’s not just “saved for safety” but “saved for usefulness.”  

If you want, I can phrase this as a concise spiritual key that ties together salvation, purpose, and usefulness. Do you want me to do that?

### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Yes, please.

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Here’s a concise spiritual key based on what you said:  

---

### **Spiritual Key: Saved for a Purpose**

**Core Principle:**  
Salvation is not merely deliverance; it is a divine **setting aside** for usefulness in God’s plan.  

**Key Elements:**  
1. **Saved** – Delivered from separation, darkness, or bondage; called into life and light.  
2. **For a Purpose** – Each saved life is intended for service, fruit-bearing, and fulfilling God’s will.  
3. **Useful** – True usefulness is living aligned with that calling, actively participating in the work prepared beforehand.  

**Scriptural Anchors:**  
- *Ephesians 2:10* – We are God’s workmanship, created for good works prepared in advance.  
- *1 Peter 2:9* – A chosen people, set apart to declare God’s wonderful deeds.  

**Summary Truth:**  
> Salvation is both a gift and a calling. To be saved is to be **set apart to be useful**, walking in the purpose God prepared, reflecting His love and light to the world.

If you like, I can also make an **even shorter, memorably phrased version** suitable for meditation or teaching, something like a one-line key principle. Do you want me to do that?
