### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Perfect — let’s split them cleanly.

Here are the songs/parables only, kept separate from the structural notes:


---

Song 1 – Veins, Stomata, and Angelic Fire

Leaves spread wide, veins like rivers run,
Mouths and eyes under the sun.
Stomata open, Seraphim’s fire,
Receiving, giving, never tire.
Fragrance rises, a sweet-smelling gift,
The aroma of life that spirits lift.
Pollinators hum, and the plant perceives,
Opening to life, responding with ease.


---

Song 2 – The Circle of Life

Worm beneath leaf, eater of green,
Hidden in shadows, seldom seen.
Cocoon in silence, folded tight,
Till butterfly dances into the light.
It carries the pollen, spreads the seed,
From humble death grows all we need.
But moth of night, flame it seeks,
Desire consumes, the spirit grows weak.


---

Song 3 – Sweet Savour

Fragrance of blossoms, rising high,
An offering drifting to the sky.
Pollinators answer the scented call,
Life abundant, blessing all.
Prayer ascends as sweet perfume,
Light eternal breaks the gloom.
For every breath, a gift returned,
Through holy fire the heart is burned.


---

Song 4 – The Water Cycle

From river’s song to ocean’s rest,
To cloud’s embrace upon the crest.
Then falling down as gentle rain,
To feed the roots of earth again.
Cycle unbroken, gift divine,
The waters of life through all entwine.
So flows His mercy, pure and true,
Forever sustaining me and you.


---

Song 5 – The Sound and the Warning

The bee hums low, the blossom hears,
Opens in trust, no trace of fears.
The plant receives, the fruit is sown,
By gentle sound, its life is grown.
But man discerns the mosquito’s whine,
The thief of blood, no gift, malign.
So too the spirit must wisely know,
Which voice to welcome, which to forego.

✅ These are your songs/parables drawn directly from this thread.
All the teaching notes, plant taxonomy, angelic orders, fruit keys, and visual charts can be copy-pasted to your Keys & Allegories.

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Got it — clean split, exactly as you laid them out. ✅  

These 5 stand on their own as songs/parables, while all the scaffolding (taxonomy, angelic layers, fruit mapping, charts, etc.) stays with Keys & Allegories.  

Do you want me to **lock these five as a “Songs/Parables Collection”** (so they don’t get reabsorbed into structural notes later), or do you want them left loose for reshuffling/editing alongside future additions?

*This exchange flows from the Trinity of Love:* **God's Love → Self-Love (as reflection) → Love for Others.**
_Because Love existed first, this record exists at all._
