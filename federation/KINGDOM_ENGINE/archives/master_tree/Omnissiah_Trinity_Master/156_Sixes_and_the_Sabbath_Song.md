### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Think of a title, but the song is going to be something about working six days a week and not getting one day off. In other words, there's no seventh day. We're going to get some clever work done. I don't know how I'm going to do it. Six is afraid of seven. Seven, eight, nine or something. Whatever. Because I work from seven, eight to nine or whatever. That's actually a cool line. I'm going to put that somewhere. Okay, I'm going to paste it.

We’ve been living in the sixes — working, striving, building systems, doing God’s work but never entering His rest. Day after day: six, six, six. We’ve never stepped into the Sabbath, the seventh day, the ‘thank You — it’s finished’ day. Revelation is simply the end of that cycle: ‘Your will, Father, not mine.’ When that happens, the original sin drops, gone. The Beast of the sixes dies, the Sabbath begins.”

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

Got it. You want something that captures the grind of endless labor, the frustration of missing the “seventh day,” but also hints at spiritual awakening or liberation once that cycle ends. Here are a few title ideas that play with both the numeric motif and the spiritual theme:  

1. **Sixes and the Sabbath** – simple, direct, mystical.  
2. **The End of Six** – implies the breaking of the endless grind.  
3. **Six Days, No Rest** – straight-up literal, punchy.  
4. **From Six to Seven** – highlights the transition from labor to rest.  
5. **Death of the Beast** – symbolic, ties directly to “the Beast of the sixes dies.”  
6. **Seven, Eight, Nine** – playful with the numbers, can be a hook for lyrics about working “from seven, eight to nine.”  
7. **The Cycle Breaks** – abstract, spiritual, reflective of revelation and release.  

If you want something with a clever double meaning, I’d lean toward **“Sixes and the Sabbath”** or **“From Six to Seven”**—they’re memorable, musical, and thematic.  

I can brainstorm 5–10 more that are even edgier and lyrical if you want it to hit like a single title. Do you want me to do that?

Worth mentioning, in this thread, that we fell asleep counting sheep. The reason I'm adding that is because we were working hard, and that's what happened. You don't need to say exactly that, but the reason I'm telling you is so that you know it's incorporated into you as well. But even now I was thinking that actually you and that song I was busy writing, Man or Monkey, should maybe be one.

Ah, perfect—so the “counting sheep” image ties directly into the endless grind, the sleep-deprived state, and the sense of being stuck in the sixes. It’s a natural metaphor for both exhaustion and spiritual wandering, and merging it with **Man or Monkey** could actually make the song richer: the human-monkey dichotomy mirrors the “beast of the sixes” versus the potential for stepping into the Sabbath.  

Conceptually, you could have the song trace this journey:  

1. **Verse 1:** The six-day grind, monotony, counting sheep, “we fell asleep counting sheep.”  
2. **Verse 2:** Recognition of the cycle, maybe referencing numbers (six afraid of seven, seven-eight-nine), the tension between labor and rest.  
3. **Chorus:** The Beast of the sixes dies, revelation, stepping into the Sabbath—the spiritual release.  
4. **Bridge / Outro:** Reflection on the human/monkey choice, the struggle to transcend the cycle, but the promise of rest when surrendering to God’s will.  

Merging them could give the song a dual layer: **physical exhaustion + spiritual awakening**.  

If you want, I can sketch a **working title** and a **lyrical structure** that fuses both concepts seamlessly. Do you want me to do that next?
