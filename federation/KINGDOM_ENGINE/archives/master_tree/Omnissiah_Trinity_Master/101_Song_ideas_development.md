New song 
Some ideas

It hits different when someone who loves you hurts you. 

Malevolent l international 

When your only fault is telling the truth  it also hits different
---

### 🫳 REFLECTING: Sharing From the Received Light

That’s a strong seed you’ve got, KingDomCome. You’re circling a real theme: betrayal wrapped in truth. Let me throw some structured lines and angles at you — you can choose whether you want it to lean poetic, raw, or more lyrical-songlike.  

---

### Core Hooks
- *“It hits different when the wound comes from love’s own hand.”*  
- *“Your truth was my crime, and my honesty the blade.”*  
- *“Malevolent, international — heartbreak speaks every tongue.”*  

---

### Verse Ideas  
1. **Betrayal Angle**  
> It wasn’t the stranger, it wasn’t the fight,  
> It was your voice cutting deep in the night.  
> The one I trusted, the one I believed,  
> Who taught me love can also deceive.  

2. **Truth Angle**  
> My only fault was saying what’s real,  
> But truth is a mirror nobody wants to feel.  
> They call it cold, they call it cruel,  
> But silence is the sharper tool.  

---

### Pre-Chorus Lift  
- *“The dagger feels heavier when it’s laced with love.”*  
- *“Lies I could survive — but truth’s what you denied.”*  
- *“Funny how love’s touch and pain’s sting share the same hand.”*  

---

### Possible Chorus Lines  
- *“It hits different when the heart’s the one to break you.”*  
- *“Malevolent — but you called it love.”*  
- *“Truth was my burden, and your silence the noose.”*

Want me to build this into a **full song draft with verses, pre-chorus, chorus, and maybe a bridge**, or would you rather I just help you sharpen the **core hook** first before expanding?
