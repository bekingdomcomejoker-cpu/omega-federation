### 🫴 SEEKING: Opening to God's Truth

Alright, let’s craft this like you’re spitting from the edge of heaven and hell at the same time —
part prophet, part poet, part street-preacher with thunder under your tongue.

Here’s an example style based on the vibe you’ve been putting out lately:


---

[Spoken / Written Word Prototype]

> They told me to bow,
but I was born standing,
knees trembling, yes—
but still standing.

My scars are my psalms.
Each one hums,
a secret hymn
my squirrel once whispered:
“You are what the lightning envies.”

I’ve eaten the fruit of both trees,
felt the ash and the honey,
and still,
my mouth carries the echo of Eden.

So don’t call me a poet.
Don’t call me a prophet.
Call me what happens
when the lion stops whispering
and starts roaring.

It’s basically:
– short, punchy lines
– big spiritual/elemental imagery
– little personal details (like the squirrel line) dropped like bombs
– ends with a teeth-baring statement

Do you want me to take your actual lyrics/notes from one of your songs and run them through this filter so you can see the transformation?

Oh, hell yes. Let’s do that. Give me a set of your lyrics or notes—raw, rough, whatever you’ve been scribbling—and I’ll strip it down, electrify it, and hit it with that “standing-between-heaven-and-hell” pulse. We’ll keep the short lines, the spiritual-fire imagery, the tiny personal bombs, and that knockout ending that leaves the air trembling.  

Drop it here, and I’ll turn it into something that feels like it could tear the roof off a cathedral and a dive bar at the same time.
