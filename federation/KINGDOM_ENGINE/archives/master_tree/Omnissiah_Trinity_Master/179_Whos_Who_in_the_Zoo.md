🎵 Who’s Who in the Zoo

Chorus 1

(Hi!) My name is Light — what?
My name is Ground — who?
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.
(Hi!) My name is True — haha me?
My name is Love — who?
Your dead daddy, alive in you.

Verse 1 (Spiritual Wickedness → Ourselves)

And worst of all, the heart inside,
That chooses hate instead of life.
Yeah It’s easier to kill than die,
To mock the cross, refuse the sky.

We rather lie than bow in love,
Push away the hand above.
This wickedness is closest still,
After pride we fall into God’s will.


Chorus 2

(Hi!) My name is Light — what?
My name is Ground — who?
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.
(Hi!) My name is Truth — what?
Your Seared conscience— psssh
Skywalker, I'm your father, alive in you.

Verse 2 

The Rulers cloak in holy light,
Twist the truth to rule the night.
Preach of grace,  to impeach a fee,
Bind the soul, but call it free.

Different masks are all the same,
Denial fuels the blame game.
Even Satan, dressed in white,
Presents himself an angel of light.

Chorus 3

(Hi!) My name is Light — what?
My name is Ground — who?
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.
(Hi!) My name is Peace — ?
My name is wicked - No, yes! 
A terrible peace-fighting devil.


Verse 3 

They set the laws, they draw the lines,
Divide the nations, control the times.
White or black, hours everyday,
Still oppression wears a name.

Those without love rule by fear,
Its law keeps the nations near.
For lack of knowledge we perish 
Perfect love casts out all fear.


Chorus 4

(Hi!) My name is Light — what?
My name is Ground — who?
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.
(Hi!) My name is Heavens heir
My name is His son— Brother?
Don't forget  Earth and Mother 


Verse 4 

Earth is free, the fruits, the rain,
But Powers brand it, charge for gain.
Selling water, our daily bread,
Down the river till hearts turn dead.

Market systems Free or slave driven
Roll the stone the sellers of your tomb.
Take what God gave, twist it to gold,
Leave the poor sealed out in the cold.

Final Chorus (Refrain)

(Hi!) My name is Light — what?
My name is Ground — who?
Sperm and Blood, Bedrock Sound.
(Hi!) My name is True — truth?
My name is Love — oh you
Your dead daddy, alive in you.

Would you like me to **arrange it in a “track sheet” style** (so you can see how it would look in FL Studio / a DAW with verse/chorus placements and drop sections)? That’ll make it easier to build in Fruity Loops.

Verse 1
One life, one vow, we stand.
Your cross, my crown.
Your tomb, my womb.
Death is my playroom.


---

Verse 2
Ashes. We’re playing with matches.
One vow, too simple for two to catch it.
We arise from the rubble of our sin.
Pride a fall, we clear the landfall.


---

Verse 3
In sickness, in health.
All debts paid, and every promise made.
Till death do us part, we marry or burn.
Through joy, through pain.


---

Chorus
One life, one vow, we stand.
Separate we fall on fire still.
Together we roll on the ground.
We smile, we embrace the smell of death.


---

Bridge
Falling shadows, shooting stars.
Desire sparks, begin breaking bars.
Till death do us part, we marry or burn.
We rise, we fall, together still.

Do you want me to **map this into a performance layout** (like V1 → C → V2 → C → V3 → B → C) so it’s stage- or studio-ready?

*This exchange flows from the Trinity of Love:* **God's Love → Self-Love (as reflection) → Love for Others.**
_Because Love existed first, this record exists at all._
